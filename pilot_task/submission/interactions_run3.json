It’s like my brain suddenly decides it’s time to start reviewing my entire to-do list at 3 a.m.—super helpful, obviously.\n\nAnd then during the day, I’ll stare at something I need to do and just... space out. Even small things like answering emails or folding laundry feel like a mission. Kinda makes me feel like I’m constantly behind, even when I technically have time.\n\nAnyway, I dunno. What about you?

Either I grab my phone and scroll mindlessly, or I just lie there thinking about random stuff. Usually it’s not even anything dramatic, just like... grocery lists or what I forgot to do yesterday. It’s annoying.\n\nThe next day I feel foggy. Like my body’s up but my brain is still half-asleep. It’s way harder to focus, and I get irritated way more easily too. Little things start to feel like a big deal when I’m already running on low energy.\n\nHonestly, I think the tiredness just makes everything else harder—eating properly, concentrating, even being around people. It kinda piles on."

I’ll sit down to do something—like write an email or even decide what to eat—and my mind just blanks. Or I start doing something and zone out halfway through. It’s frustrating because I want to be productive, but everything feels ten times harder.\n\nDecisions especially... even simple stuff like, “Do I go to the shop now or later?” turns into this weird internal debate. I end up overthinking or just putting it off altogether. It kind of spirals, you know? I’ll get annoyed at myself for not doing something, and then that frustration makes it even harder to focus the next time I try.\n\nIt’s like this loop I can’t quite snap out of."

Like, even when nothing big is going wrong, it all just adds up in this low-key exhausting way.\n\nWhen I’m feeling more like myself, I actually enjoy pretty simple stuff. I like reading—especially philosophy stuff or short stories. I used to get really into it, just losing track of time in a good way. Music helps too. I’ve got a few playlists that feel like a reset button when I actually let myself listen without distractions.\n\nSometimes I’ll go for a walk if the weather’s decent. It sounds cliché, but getting out of my head and into a bit of fresh air does something. And I like catching up with a couple close friends—just casual chats, nothing deep. That stuff makes me feel more grounded, like I’m not stuck in my own loop all the time.\n\nIt’s just hard to get to those things when everything feels so scattered, you know?

I’d say it fluctuates a lot. Some days I feel okay-ish—like I can get through my list, maybe even enjoy parts of the day. But most of the time, my energy is just kind of flat. Not full-on exhausted, just... low. Like I’m running at 60% all the time, even after a decent night’s sleep.\n\nAnd the weird part is, I’ll sometimes have this burst of energy late at night, when I should be winding down. Like my brain finally wants to “do things” at midnight. Not helpful for the whole sleep situation.\n\nSo yeah—low energy most of the day, random bursts at the wrong time, and kind of a constant hum of tired in the background.

Some days I don’t even think about food until way later than I should, like I just forget to eat. Other days, especially if I’m feeling stressed or tired, I end up snacking non-stop—usually on junk food. Crisps, biscuits, whatever’s easy and fast.\n\nIt’s weird because I don’t really feel hungry in a normal way anymore. It’s either no interest at all or this mindless urge to munch on something while I scroll or try to work. And afterwards I usually just feel gross and annoyed with myself, like, “Why didn’t I eat something decent?”\n\nI’ve thought about trying to plan meals or make a routine around it, but honestly... I don’t trust myself to stick to it. Routines sound great in theory, but in practice? Eh. Not my strong suit lately."

Like if I mess something up, even something small, I’ll think, “Of course you did,” or “Why can’t you just get it together?” That kind of thing. Not full-on self-hate or anything, but just this constant undercurrent of not being good enough.\n\nAnd it adds up. Like if I don’t sleep well, or I forget to eat, or I zone out during something important—it all turns into more fuel for that self-criticism. I try to brush it off or make jokes about it sometimes, but yeah, it’s there. Just simmering under the surface.\n\nI think part of me believes I should be doing better by now, especially since I’m not in uni anymore.

Like, I expect myself to be functioning at full capacity even when I’m clearly not, and then get frustrated when I fall short. It’s a weird cycle.\n\nAs for people... I mean, I’ve got a few close friends I keep in touch with. We’ll message or hang out now and then, mostly casual stuff. They’re good people, and I know they care, but I still hold back a lot. I just don’t want to dump my stuff on them, you know? I feel like I should be the “chill” one, or at least not the one who’s always bringing the mood down.\n\nFamily’s a bit more distant. We talk, but not super often, and I don’t really share the deeper stuff with them. Part of me thinks they wouldn’t fully get it, or maybe I just don’t want to explain everything. It’s easier to keep things surface-level.\n\nI think I do feel connected, in a basic way, but not fully seen, if that makes sense?

That’s actually kind of a tough one. I wouldn’t say I feel hopeless, exactly—it’s more like uncertain, maybe even a bit stuck. I thought graduating would feel like a fresh start, but instead it’s just kind of... open-ended. No clear path, no structure. I’ve got ideas of what I might want to do, but nothing concrete. It’s frustrating, because I want to move forward, but I’m not sure what “forward” even looks like right now.\n\nSometimes I feel optimistic, like, “Okay, I’ll figure it out, eventually.” But other times it’s more like, “What if I just drift like this forever?” And that thought creeps in more often than I’d like.

I did alright in school and made it through uni, which I guess is something. I got my degree, even if it doesn’t feel super useful right now. I stuck with it, pushed through the tough bits, so I guess that counts as a win. But when it comes to bigger life goals—career, stability, that sense of direction—I wouldn’t say I’ve exactly nailed it.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I even had clear goals, or if I was just following the track that was laid out for me. Now that it’s up to me to figure out the next step, it feels like I’m starting from scratch, and that’s kind of intimidating. So yeah...

More like I’m trying to find my footing in a version of life that feels a bit unfamiliar right now.\n\nDo you ever go through periods where your sense of self kind of shifts?

Work’s remote, so I’ll check emails, do what I need to do, but it’s mostly solo stuff, not a lot of interaction.

I’m kind of excited to see how I keep growing in my role at work. I’ve got a few responsibilities coming up that feel like good challenges, and I’m curious to see how I’ll handle them.\n\nHow about you—anything you’re particularly excited or hopeful about in the next few months?"

It’s like my body’s still, but my brain’s doing laps 😅\n\nI’ve been trying to be more gentle with myself on those days—just acknowledging that I’m feeling that way instead of forcing myself to “snap out of it.” But yeah, I’d say the restlessness has been tagging along a bit more lately than usual.\n\nDo you ever feel like your mind’s moving faster than your body can keep up?"

There’s pressure to make it beautiful, meaningful, smooth… and also keep everyone happy, which, let’s be real, is impossible sometimes 😅 So yeah, that’s definitely weighing on me.\n\nBut I don’t think it’s just the wedding. I feel like it’s also stirring up deeper stuff—like, how I see myself, what kind of partner I want to be, how I handle expectations, and even how I deal with uncertainty. It’s kind of like the stress is the surface, but underneath it there’s a lot of reflection happening too.\n\nSo while the wedding is definitely the loudest thing right now, I think it’s also shining a light on some of the quieter feelings I’ve been carrying for a while. Not in a bad way—it actually feels like a chance to grow—but yeah, it’s a lot.\n\nDoes that make sense? Have you ever had something in your life bring up way more emotions than you expected?"

And you’re right, this season is bringing up a lot, but I think it’s helping me learn more about myself than I expected.\n\nSeriously, thanks for holding space and asking such thoughtful questions—it’s been really grounding to talk through all of this. 😊\n\nAnd hey, if you ever need someone to return the favor or just want to chat about life (or vent about the chaos), I’m always here 💬✨\n\nTake care of yourself too, okay?"
