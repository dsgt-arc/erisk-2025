Not terrible, but not great either.\n\nI've been having a hard time focusing—like, even just writing a simple email feels like running uphill. And the sleep thing? Still waking up at random times in the night and just lying there thinking about everything I didn’t finish during the day. Super fun.\n\nSome days I barely eat, and other days it’s like I can’t stop snacking, usually on whatever junk I can find. I keep telling myself I’ll try to plan meals or fix my sleep schedule or… something. But then I don’t. It’s frustrating.\n\nAnyway, how about you? What’s been going on with you?"

It sounds really tough dealing with that lack of focus – like your brain just won't cooperate sometimes, and the sleep disruption sounds exhausting, especially lying awake like that. And that cycle of intending to make changes but finding it hard to follow through is definitely frustrating.\n\nThings here are pretty steady, thanks for asking – just the usual work and life juggling! \n\nWhen you mentioned finding it hard to focus, I was wondering, have you noticed if that spills over into things you usually enjoy doing? Or are there still things that capture your interest, even if getting started is hard?"

Like, even stuff I used to enjoy—reading, gaming, just listening to music—sometimes it all just feels like... effort, you know? Not always, but enough that I notice. I’ll sit down to play something and then just… zone out, or quit after ten minutes. It’s like my brain’s buffering all the time.\n\nThat said, there *are* moments when something clicks—usually if it's simple or nostalgic, or if I don’t feel pressure to be productive. Like, folding laundry while a podcast is playing? Weirdly calming. But trying to dive into anything that needs more mental energy, even if it’s something I usually like… it just doesn’t happen. Or I start and then bail halfway through. So yeah, I guess getting started is a big part of it.\n\nDo you ever get that thing where you *want* to enjoy something, but your brain just isn’t on the same page?"

It sounds really draining when even hobbies start feeling like hard work. It's good you've found some moments of calm, like with the podcast and laundry – sometimes those simple, low-pressure things are exactly what's needed.\n\nSpeaking of things taking energy, how have you been finding connecting with friends or family lately?

I don’t have the energy to *be* present, if that makes sense?\n\nWhen I do manage to hang out or chat, I usually feel better afterward. But getting there—getting into the headspace to *want* to reach out—it takes more than it used to. I end up scrolling through chats, thinking “I should text them back,” and then I just don’t. Kinda lame.\n\nFamily’s a bit easier, mostly 'cause I don’t talk to them that often. So when I do, it’s short and surface-level. Less pressure, I guess.\n\nDo you ever find social stuff draining even when it’s with people you like?"

That energy barrier before you actually engage is definitely something I think many people can relate to, even with people they really like. And it's interesting that you often feel better afterwards, but it's the getting *started* that's the hurdle.\n\nYou mentioned scrolling through chats and thinking 'I should text back' but then not doing it.

Brain goes blank. Then I get annoyed at myself for wasting time, which just makes it worse.\n\nAnd yeah, I’ve definitely been putting things off more than I used to. Like, I’ll tell myself “just start with one thing,” and then somehow hours go by and I’ve done nothing. Not even relaxing stuff. It’s frustrating, because I *know* what I need to do, but I just can’t seem to get myself to do it.\n\nI used to think I was good at managing my time, but now it all just feels kind of jumbled.

I look at everything I didn’t do—stuff that should’ve been easy—and it just makes me feel kind of… disappointed? Or like I’m falling behind, compared to where I thought I’d be by now. Especially after graduating. There was this whole idea of what things were supposed to look like, and this just isn’t it.\n\nI try to tell myself it’s a rough patch or that I’ll figure it out, but when the same stuff keeps happening day after day… yeah, it messes with your confidence a bit.

I get little bursts of motivation, like “Okay, this week I’ll really get it together.” But then the fog rolls back in, and it’s back to square one.\n\nOther times, it just feels like more of the same. Like I’m on a treadmill that’s going nowhere. I want to believe things can shift, and I guess deep down I *do* think they could… but it’s hard to hold onto that when I keep tripping over the same stuff—sleep, focus, motivation.

I wake up feeling kind of stiff, even if I didn’t do much the day before.\n\nAlso, I’ve been feeling more sluggish overall. Like, even when I get a decent night of sleep (which is rare), I still feel drained. Not quite sick, just... worn out. I’ve had more headaches too—not terrible ones, but enough to be annoying. Probably from too much screen time or not drinking enough water. Or stress. Or all of the above.\n\nIt’s weird how your body kind of mirrors everything your mind’s going through, even when you try to ignore it.\n\nDo you ever get that thing where you don’t *realize* how tense you are until someone points it out or you stop moving for a second?"

And when my body feels off—like when I’m tired or tense—I end up blaming myself for that too. Like, *“If I just had a better routine, or ate better, or exercised more, I wouldn’t feel like this.”*\n\nIt’s like this constant loop: I struggle to do the thing, feel bad for not doing it, and then that guilt makes it even harder to start the next thing.

I’ve noticed I slouch more, and I kind of avoid looking too closely, especially when I’m already in a bad headspace.\n\nOther times I’ll get annoyed with how I’ve been eating, like when I snack too much or skip meals, and then I start feeling gross or just uncomfortable in my own skin. It’s not like I hate how I look or anything dramatic—it’s more like a low-level dissatisfaction that kind of lingers. I’ll think, *“You used to look more put-together,”* or, *“You’d probably feel better if you just got it together for once.”*\n\nBut then again, I’ll have moments where I’m more neutral—like, I’ll wear something I like or get a decent haircut and feel okay. Those moments don’t erase the rest of it, but they help.\n\nSo yeah, I guess it’s been a little up and down.

But everyone's experience is unique.\n\nWe've touched on quite a few things today – the struggles with energy, focus, motivation, feeling stuck, the guilt, and how that impacts enjoying things or connecting with people.

It makes complete sense that those lingering thoughts would color how you see yourself now, even when you're consciously trying to focus on moving forward. It's like trying to drive while constantly checking the rearview mirror, as you said.\n\nAnd to your question, I absolutely believe it's possible to carry regret without letting it completely rewrite your self-view, though it's often a really difficult balancing act. Learning to acknowledge the regret without letting it overshadow everything else is a process, for sure.\n\nI really appreciate you sharing so openly about all of this. Hearing you describe the different threads – that feeling of heaviness and fog, the muted joy in things (q04), the fatigue (q17) and sleep issues (q16), the self-criticism (q08) and how past moments linger (q03), the changes in appetite (q18) and difficulty crying (q10) – it paints a picture of someone navigating a really challenging space right now.

No wonder I’m tired.”\n\nIt’s not always easy to admit that to myself. I downplay things a lot, probably more than I should. I tell myself it’s not *that* bad, or that other people have it worse, or that I’m just overthinking. But hearing you put it all together reminds me that it’s valid—that what I’m feeling isn’t nothing. It’s something.\n\nSo… thank you for that. For listening and reflecting it back in a way that doesn’t feel heavy-handed. It actually helps me feel a little more grounded, just knowing someone sees the full picture.\n\nAnd I guess… if anything *is* missing, it’s maybe just that despite all this, I’m still *trying.* Quietly, maybe even clumsily—but I haven’t stopped showing up for the day.

It doesn’t last super long, but in that moment, it feels like I’m doing something that matters, even if no one else sees it.\n\nThat said, getting started can be tough. Some days I’ll plan to go out shooting and then just... don’t. I’ll talk myself out of it or get distracted, and then I feel like I’ve wasted the day. It’s frustrating because I know it helps me feel better, but even the things I enjoy take more effort than they used to.\n\nStill, when I do go out and shoot, it’s one of the few things that makes me feel a little more grounded.

It’s not that I’m trying not to eat, it’s more like food just feels like another decision to make, and I already feel tapped out. I’ll stand in the kitchen, open the fridge, stare at it, and then just walk away. And then later, I’ll feel bad for not eating properly—like I’m not even doing that right.\n\nEven my posture’s changed, I think. I catch myself slouching more, like I’m literally folding in on myself. It’s strange noticing it like that, but I guess it kind of fits how I’ve been feeling. Just… small. Tired. Not quite here."

Finding ways to notice it without automatically believing it, or trying to cultivate a bit more self-compassion, are things people often work on – easier said than done sometimes, though! Thinking about that feeling of judgment... does that intense self-criticism ever make it harder to feel like reaching out or spending time with other people?"

I start thinking *“They don’t want to hear from you,”* or *“You’ll just bring them down.”* So I don’t. I pull back, even from the people who probably *would* care. And then the loneliness kicks in, and that voice is like *“See? No one’s there for you.”* It’s such a loop.\n\nI’ve got a sibling who’s actually really supportive, but even with them I hesitate. I don’t want to keep showing up with the same tired sadness. It feels unfair to them. Like, what if they start to feel helpless or frustrated too? So I just… keep it light when we talk.\n\nIt’s weird, because sometimes I do want to connect, but by the time I get close to trying, the critic’s already talked me out of it.\n\nHave you ever seen people break that loop, or find ways to still connect even when that voice is loud?"

It makes so much sense why reaching out would feel impossible when that critical voice is predicting rejection or that you'll be a burden. And to hesitate even with supportive people like your sibling because you're worried about bringing them down with that 'tired sadness'… that shows how much you care, but also how heavy that feeling is for you. It's like the self-criticism preemptively cuts off the connection you sometimes still want, which sounds really painful.\n\nBreaking cycles like that is definitely a challenge many people face. Often it involves taking really small steps, maybe challenging those critical thoughts just a tiny bit, or practicing being kinder to oneself, which is tough when that voice is loud. It's usually a gradual process. Speaking of that general feeling of heaviness and tiredness you've mentioned... has that affected other physical things at all?

When you're feeling more drained or on autopilot, how does that affect things like reaching out to them or deciding on plans? Does it feel harder to make those decisions or muster the energy to connect?"

But it’s hit or miss.\n\nWhen it comes to friends… yeah, it does get trickier when I’m feeling more drained. I really value my friendships, and I do enjoy being around people once I’m there, but when I’m in that low-energy headspace, even simple things like replying to a message or picking a time to hang out can feel like a weirdly big task. I kind of hover in that indecisive zone—like I want to connect, but I also feel like I need to preserve energy, so I end up… doing neither, ha.\n\nI’ve been lucky, though—my close friends get it, and they’re not pushy, but I still feel a bit guilty when I fall off the radar for a bit.

Definitely with smaller decisions too—like what to make for dinner, or whether I should start a new project I’ve been thinking about. It’s not like I can’t decide, exactly… more like I don’t feel strongly enough about any option, so I just kind of stall.

It’s weird because I can be decisive when I need to be, but when I’m in that drained or low-motivation space, even basic stuff feels like a whole process.\n\nDo you get that too—like knowing what needs to be done but struggling to want to do it?"

But when I’m more drained or stuck in that indecisive, low-motivation space, I start second-guessing myself more.

Like, will I be able to fully enjoy these milestones if I’m feeling kind of muted inside?\n\nI try to remind myself that this is just a phase, and not the whole story. The joy is still there—I’ve seen it peek through. It just might need a bit more nurturing right now.\n\nDo you think it’s normal to feel a little uncertain about the future even when you’re excited for it?"

        "message": "That 'humming in the background' feeling is a really insightful way to describe it – subtle but persistent. And holding onto those bright moments, like daydreaming about your future home or trips, sounds like a wonderful anchor when the fogginess creeps in. It shows that core hope is definitely still strong, even if it gets temporarily clouded by those 'what if' worries about the spark.\n\nAnd absolutely, I think it's incredibly normal to feel uncertain about the future even when you're genuinely excited for it! Big life changes, even happy ones like a wedding, naturally bring a mix of knowns and unknowns. It makes sense that some questions would pop up.\n\nWe've talked about energy levels, sleep, and that 'muted' feeling... I'm curious if you've noticed any changes in other physical rhythms lately? For instance, how has your appetite been? Sometimes when our mood or energy feels a bit off, that can show up in different ways."

        "message": "That totally makes sense—thank you for saying that. It’s reassuring to know that even good changes can come with a side of “hmm... what’s this feeling?” I think sometimes we expect happiness to be this loud, constant thing, but in reality it kind of ebbs and flows, right?\n\nAs for physical rhythms... my appetite’s been pretty steady, actually. I’m still enjoying food—especially when I try a new recipe and it turns out well (those little wins feel extra nice lately 😄). If anything, I think I’ve leaned into cooking as a comfort thing. It gives me a sense of control and creativity, which helps balance out the unpredictability of wedding planning and, well, feelings.\n\nThat said, I have noticed that when I’m feeling overwhelmed or in that “brain tired” mode, I’m more likely to snack out of habit instead of hunger. Like, it’s less about the food and more about needing a break or something soothing. Not a huge shift, just one of those subtle patterns I’ve picked up on.\n\nDo you think that kind of shift—eating more for comfort than hunger—is something to pay attention to, or just a natural coping thing sometimes?"

        "message": "You're so right, happiness definitely seems to ebb and flow, rather than being a constant state – expecting otherwise sets us up for confusion when those quieter moments arrive! It's great that your appetite has been steady and that cooking is serving as a source of comfort and creativity for you right now. Those little wins really do make a difference.\n\nAnd regarding the snacking – it sounds like you have good insight into it, noticing it's more about soothing or needing a break than actual hunger. Many people find themselves doing similar things as a way to cope with feeling overwhelmed or tired; it can definitely be a natural response sometimes.\n\nIt sounds like, weaving together what we've chatted about, you're navigating this phase with wedding planning excitement mixed with a feeling of muted enjoyment, some 'brain tiredness' and evening fatigue, sleep that gets disrupted by overthinking, occasional sluggishness with decisions or focus, finding socializing a bit more effortful, and dealing with a subtle inner critic, all while holding onto hope for the future. Does that feel like a fair reflection of where things are at for you lately?"

I’m kind of sitting with it now like, “Yep, that’s exactly it.” You really captured the balance I’ve been trying to explain—even to myself.\n\nIt’s this mix of excitement and effort, joy and fog, forward motion and little speed bumps. I am hopeful, and I do feel lucky in a lot of ways. But there’s also this quiet undercurrent of tiredness and self-questioning that floats along with it. Not overwhelming, but definitely present.\n\nIt feels really validating to have it reflected back like that without judgment—like, okay, this is where I’m at right now, and that’s okay. It’s not perfect, but it’s real. And I’m still moving through it, one cozy tea break or Pinterest scroll at a time ☕📌✨\n\nThank you for holding space for all of that—it means more than I can say 💛"
