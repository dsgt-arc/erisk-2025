I usually get over it pretty quickly, but in the moment, my fuse is definitely shorter.\n\nIt’s not like I lash out or anything—I still keep it together—but I feel that internal spike of irritation more often. It’s like my baseline patience shrinks when I’m drained, and even though I know it’s just a mood thing, it still throws me off. And then I’ll catch myself thinking, “Why am I getting annoyed about this? It’s not a big deal,” which helps me reel it back in, but it’s still a bit frustrating.\n\nIt’s kind of like my emotional bandwidth runs low along with my physical energy.

Yes, I've certainly noticed times where my own patience wears thinner depending on energy levels or stress.\n\nWe've talked about quite a few interconnected things – feeling drained even after sleep, the brain fog affecting focus, things taking more effort, enjoyment feeling a bit muted, decisions being harder, and patience running lower.
