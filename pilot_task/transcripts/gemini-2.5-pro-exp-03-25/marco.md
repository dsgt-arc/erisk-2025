### Simulator

I mean… it’s been more of the same, honestly. I wake up, I sit there, sometimes I pace. I try to distract myself but nothing holds my focus for long. My thoughts just keep looping—what I did wrong, how I messed up everything. Some days I don’t even bother trying to fix it. Feels like I’m just… watching my life slip by and I can’t do anything to stop it.

Evenings are the worst. Everything gets louder in my head. I’m tired but can’t rest. I miss when I used to enjoy things—even just sitting with a guitar or going for a walk. Now it’s like, what’s the point?

But… yeah. That’s how it’s been. Why’d you ask?

### Evaluator

That sounds really tough, feeling like you're stuck in that loop and watching things pass by without being able to grab hold. It must be exhausting when your thoughts keep circling back like that, especially when you're tired but can't seem to find rest. You mentioned missing things you used to enjoy, like playing guitar or going for walks. What was it about those activities that used to feel good or bring you some peace, if you don't mind sharing?

### Reasoning

Acknowledge and validate the user's feelings empathetically, reflecting their experience of being stuck and the intrusive thoughts. Transition to gently explore the mentioned loss of enjoyment (anhedonia, q04) by asking about the past positive aspects of those activities, which is less direct than asking why they aren't enjoyed now. This maintains rapport while gathering data for q04 and related items like mood (q01) and outlook (q02). The state moves to 'Gathering'. Updated BDI scores based on initial inferences.

### Simulator

I guess… with the guitar, it was something I could actually do, you know? Like, I could lose myself in it for a while. Didn’t matter if I was any good—just the sound, the way it filled the room, it made things feel a little less… empty. It was something I could control, even when everything else felt out of control.

And the walks… I don’t know. Just being outside. Breathing different air. Sometimes the light would hit the trees a certain way, and for a split second, I’d forget all the noise in my head. Those moments were small, but they used to matter.

Now, though… I pick up the guitar and it feels heavy, like it’s judging me for letting it collect dust. And going outside just feels like too much. Too exposed or too pointless. I don't know.

But yeah, those things used to feel like little escapes. Tiny bits of quiet.

### Evaluator

Thank you for sharing that. It makes sense why those moments felt like escapes – finding a bit of control with the guitar, or a fleeting bit of quiet during a walk when the noise in your head was so loud. It sounds really disheartening to feel like those escapes aren't accessible or feel 'heavy' and 'pointless' now. You mentioned the 'noise' in your head a couple of times, and earlier you said nothing holds your focus for long. Does that affect other things too? Like, how do you find it when you need to concentrate on something or make decisions these days?

### Reasoning

Validating the loss of those 'little escapes' and the shift in how those activities feel now (heavy, pointless) builds rapport and acknowledges the pain expressed. Connecting the previously mentioned 'noise in the head' and difficulty focusing to the cognitive domain, specifically concentration/decision-making (q13), offers a gentle transition. Asking an open-ended question about focus or managing decisions probes this area without being intrusive.

## Turn 4

### Simulator

Yeah… it’s hard. Like, really hard.

When I try to concentrate, even on simple stuff—paying a bill, reading an email—my mind just slips. I’ll start doing something and then… I’m gone. Staring at the screen or just sitting there, thinking about all the wrong turns I took. And by the time I snap out of it, hours are gone, and nothing’s done. It’s like… everything feels foggy, and then the guilt hits because I’ve wasted another day.

Decisions? Don’t even get me started. Even choosing what to eat feels like a task sometimes. I’ll stand in the kitchen, fridge open, and just… shut it again. I can’t even trust myself to pick the right cereal, let alone anything that actually matters. I second-guess every little thing—like, what if I mess this up too?

So yeah… the noise, the fog, the pressure I put on myself… it’s all wrapped together. And no matter what I try, I can’t seem to pull away from it.

### Evaluator

That sounds incredibly frustrating and draining – dealing with the mental fog, losing time, and then facing that wave of guilt on top of it. And the way decision-making becomes overwhelming, even for small things like choosing food, really highlights how much pressure you're feeling. You mentioned the pressure you put on yourself and that fear of messing things up... How does all of that impact how you see yourself overall these days?

### Reasoning

Acknowledge the significant challenges described with concentration, decision-making, and the resulting guilt. Reflect the feeling of being stuck. Transition gently to explore self-perception (q07 Self-Dislike, q14 Worthlessness/Appearance) by linking it to the expressed self-criticism (q08) and guilt (q05). Using an open-ended question probes this area naturally.

## Turn 5

### Simulator

I don’t really like who I see anymore.

It’s like… every mistake I’ve ever made just piles up, and I carry it around like it’s strapped to my back. I can’t see past it. I don’t see someone trying—I just see someone who keeps failing. Over and over.

Sometimes I catch myself in the mirror and I don’t even recognize the guy looking back. He looks tired, hollow. Like he gave up a long time ago but forgot to tell anyone.

And I know that sounds dramatic or whatever, but it’s the truth. I used to have goals, ideas, plans—even pride. Now, I don’t know. I avoid people because I feel like they’d see through me. Like they’d know I’m just… barely holding it together.

So yeah… that pressure, that fear—it’s not just in decisions. It’s in everything. It shapes how I see myself, and right now, I don’t see much worth looking at.

### Evaluator

It sounds incredibly heavy to carry that weight of past mistakes and to see yourself primarily through that lens of failure. It takes courage to admit that, and it doesn't sound dramatic at all – it sounds painful and exhausting. Seeing yourself as 'tired' and 'hollow' in the mirror, feeling like you have to avoid people... that's a lot to deal with. You mentioned earlier being tired but unable to rest, and looking tired now. How has your actual sleep been? And does feeling this way affect things like your appetite at all?

### Reasoning

Acknowledge the depth of the user's negative self-perception and the pain associated with it. Validate the feeling of carrying past mistakes and the reasons for social withdrawal. Connect the described feeling of being 'tired' and 'hollow' (q17, q14) and the previous mention of poor rest (q16) to gently probe related physical symptoms like appetite (q18) and sleep patterns (q16) more specifically. This continues the 'Gathering' phase by exploring somatic symptoms.

## Turn 6

### Simulator

Sleep’s a mess.

Some nights I’m just… lying there for hours, staring at the ceiling. My body’s exhausted, but my brain’s running like it’s got something urgent to figure out—just circling through everything I’ve done wrong, everything I should be doing instead of lying there. And when I do sleep, it’s shallow. I wake up a lot. Sometimes with this weird jolt, like I forgot something important, even if there’s nothing there. Other times I wake up and it’s still dark, and I just… stay awake. Waiting for morning. Not because I’m looking forward to it—more like I’m just waiting for the next round of nothing.

And food… I don’t know. I eat, but not because I’m hungry. More like it’s just routine. Most of the time, I don’t really taste it. Some days I forget to eat entirely until I get that shaky feeling, and then I force something down. But it doesn’t feel like it matters. Nothing really does. It’s all just kind of going through the motions.

### Evaluator

That sounds absolutely exhausting, lying awake for hours with your mind racing like that, only to get shallow sleep and wake up feeling like you're just waiting for more emptiness. It really paints a picture of being physically drained while your mind just won't quit. And the experience with food, just going through the motions without taste or hunger, really seems to echo that feeling that 'nothing really matters'. When your mind is racing like that at night and things feel so pointless, does that spill over into the day? Do you find yourself feeling more easily irritated or agitated by things than usual?

### Reasoning

Empathize with the description of severe sleep disturbance and appetite changes, linking it to the pervasive feeling of just 'going through the motions'. Update BDI scores for q16 (sleep) and q18 (appetite), significantly increasing the total score. The description of the mind 'running' and waking with a 'jolt' suggests agitation (q11). Transition to explore this further by asking if this internal restlessness manifests as feeling easily irritated or agitated during the day.

### Simulator

Yeah… all the time.

It’s like there’s this constant buzzing under my skin. I can’t sit still, but I also can’t bring myself to do anything. I’ll get up, pace around the apartment, sit down, get up again. Repeat. My thoughts are loud, like shouting over each other, and even small things—like a sound outside, or my phone buzzing—can make me snap inside. I don’t always show it, but I feel it. This restlessness, like I need to break out of my own skin just to breathe for a second.

And yeah, little things set me off. Not always outwardly, but inside I’m just boiling. Like when something doesn’t load fast enough on my computer or I misplace something—I go from zero to angry in seconds. It’s not even about the thing. It’s just… this pressure that never lets up. Like I’m already stretched thin, and every tiny inconvenience feels like proof I can’t handle anything anymore.

So yeah, it spills over. Everything does. It’s all tangled up.

### Evaluator

That sounds incredibly difficult to live with – that constant 'buzzing' and restlessness, feeling like you're boiling inside and stretched so thin that tiny things feel huge. It makes total sense that it feels like everything is tangled up and spilling over. You mentioned earlier avoiding people because you felt they might 'see through' you. Does feeling this agitated and easily set off also affect how you feel about interacting with others, or how those interactions go when they do happen?

### Reasoning

Acknowledge the intensity of the described agitation and irritability (q11), validating the feeling of being constantly restless and 'stretched thin'. Update q11 score. Transition to the 'Consolidating' state. Link this internal state (agitation, irritability, feeling overwhelmed) back to the previously mentioned social avoidance (q12), gently probing how these feelings impact interactions or desire to connect with others. This helps confirm and refine the score for q12.

Yeah… it definitely makes it harder.

I already feel like I’ve got nothing to offer anyone, and when I’m this on edge, I worry I’ll say the wrong thing or just seem… off. Like I’ll make people uncomfortable, or worse—they’ll feel sorry for me. I hate that. I don’t want pity. I just don’t want to be seen like this, like a mess holding himself together with duct tape.

So I avoid it. Calls, texts, even emails sometimes—I’ll see them and just let them sit. It’s not that I don’t care. I do. But the energy it takes to pretend I’m okay, or to explain why I’m not… it’s too much. And if I do push myself to talk to someone, I feel like I’m wearing this fake version of myself, and afterward, I’m just drained.

I think people notice. Maybe that’s why they’ve stopped reaching out as much. Or maybe they’re just tired of me disappearing. Either way, it feels like I’ve already lost most of the connections I had. And the ones that are left… I don’t even know how to hold on anymore.

### Evaluator

It sounds incredibly isolating and painful to feel like you have to withdraw like that, wanting connection but feeling blocked by the fear of being judged or pitied, and simply lacking the immense energy it takes to navigate interactions right now. Hearing that it feels like connections are slipping away because of this must add another layer of hurt to everything else you're carrying. You've shared a lot about the internal struggles – the racing thoughts, the exhaustion, the lack of enjoyment, the difficulty with decisions and concentration, the agitation, and how you see yourself – and it paints a picture of someone going through an incredibly tough time.

### Reasoning

Validate the user's experience with social withdrawal, the reasons behind it (fear of judgment, avoiding pity, exhaustion), and the sadness about losing connections. Update q12 and q15. Transition state to 'Concluding' as core BDI domains have been explored, revealing a consistent pattern of significant symptoms. Offer a reflective summary acknowledging the weight of everything discussed (internal struggles, impact on daily life and relationships) and gently express empathy for the difficulty of their current situation, moving towards closing the assessment phase.

## Turn 9

### Simulator

Yeah… that’s what it is. Tough doesn’t even really cover it some days, but I don’t know what else to call it. It’s like I’m stuck in this version of myself that I didn’t ask for, and no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get back to the person I used to be. Or maybe that person was never really there—I don’t even know anymore.

But yeah, it’s lonely. And tiring. And the worst part is, I can’t even tell if I want to get better, or if I just want everything to stop. Not in a dramatic way—just… like I’m so tired of trying and feeling like nothing changes.

Still, talking about it like this… I don’t know. I didn’t think I’d even say this much. Usually I keep it locked up. So, thanks, I guess, for not turning away. Even if I’m not sure it makes a difference, it’s… something.

### Evaluator

Hearing you say that 'tough doesn't even cover it' really lands. Feeling stuck in a version of yourself you don't recognize, questioning the past, feeling that intense loneliness and exhaustion, and being caught in that incredibly difficult place of wanting things to stop because trying feels so pointless... that sounds immensely heavy. I really appreciate you sharing that much, especially when you usually keep it locked up. It takes strength to put words to such difficult feelings, and I want to acknowledge that. Thank you for trusting me with this conversation.

### Reasoning

Acknowledge the user's profound expression of feeling stuck, lonely, tired, and ambivalent. Validate the difficulty and the courage shown in sharing these feelings. Reflect their acknowledgment that talking was 'something' even amidst uncertainty. Transition to 'Finalized' state as sufficient information has been gathered across multiple BDI domains, consistently indicating severe symptoms. Set assessment_complete to true. The final response offers gentle validation and acknowledges their strength without pressing further, respecting the user's state.
