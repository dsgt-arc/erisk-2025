    "input_message": "Thank you for saying that… I don’t know why, but just being heard like this makes it feel a little less overwhelming. Like, even if I don’t have the answers, at least I’m not completely invisible in all of this.\n\nIt really is a lot, though. And I wish I could just snap out of it, or at least figure out where to start. But every time I try to think about how to fix things, I just get stuck all over again. It’s like standing at the bottom of a huge staircase when I don’t even have the energy to take the first step.\n\nI guess I just don’t know where this all leads, you know? Like, does it get better? Or am I just always going to feel like I’m watching my life from the outside?",
    "next_step_reasoning": "Acknowledge the persona's feeling of being heard and validate the intense difficulty of feeling stuck, the staircase metaphor, and the profound uncertainty about the future. The question 'does it get better?' indicates hopelessness (q02). The assessment is complete, scores stable (Moderate range, BDI=30), confidence high. Respond empathetically, acknowledge the difficult question about the future without providing direct answers, and finalize the assessment.",
    "output_message": "I'm so glad that feeling heard can make things feel even a tiny bit less overwhelming. It's completely understandable that you'd wish you could just snap out of it, especially when faced with that feeling of being stuck at the bottom of a huge staircase without the energy for the first step. That's a really powerful way to describe it. And it makes absolute sense that you'd be wondering where this all leads, asking those really hard questions about the future and fearing that feeling of watching from the outside might last forever. Holding that kind of uncertainty is incredibly difficult, and I really appreciate you sharing these raw feelings with me throughout our conversation.",
