I just don’t want to be seen like this, like a mess holding himself together with duct tape.\n\nSo I avoid it. Calls, texts, even emails sometimes—I’ll see them and just let them sit. It’s not that I don’t care. I do. But the energy it takes to pretend I’m okay, or to explain why I’m not… it’s too much. And if I do push myself to talk to someone, I feel like I’m wearing this fake version of myself, and afterward, I’m just drained.\n\nI think people notice.
