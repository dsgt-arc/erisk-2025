Not full-on crying usually, but that tightness in the chest, sting in the eyes—you know, like it’s right there under the surface.\n\nSometimes it hits when I least expect it. Like watching a movie with my daughter or hearing a song I used to like. It’s not even that the moment is sad—it just pokes at something I’ve been keeping down.\n\nAnd other times, I wish I *could* cry. Just let it out. But it’s like the pressure’s there without the release. Feels like carrying a full glass all day, careful not to spill anything, but your hand’s shaking.\n\nSo… yeah. It’s been harder to keep all that inside lately.",

It speaks volumes about how much you've been managing internally.\n\nReflecting on everything we've talked about – the fatigue, the flatness, the difficulty concentrating, the irritability, and this emotional weight – is there anything else that feels particularly heavy or stands out to you right now?",
