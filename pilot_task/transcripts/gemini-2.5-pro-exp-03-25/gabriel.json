When I’m out with my camera and something catches my eye, it’s like my brain quiets down for a bit. I get this small rush when I feel like I’ve framed something well or captured a moment that feels... real, I guess. It doesn’t last super long, but in that moment, it feels like I’m doing something that matters, even if no one else sees it.\n\nThat said, getting started can be tough. Some days I’ll plan to go out shooting and then just... don’t. I’ll talk myself out of it or get distracted, and then I feel like I’ve wasted the day. It’s frustrating because I know it helps me feel better, but even the things I enjoy take more effort than they used to.\n\nStill, when I do go out and shoot, it’s one of the few things that makes me feel a little more grounded.

I don’t think I’ve lost hope exactly. It’s more like… that version feels distant, and I’m not always sure how to bridge the gap from here to there.\n\nBut on the tougher days—when I’m in that fog, or the self-doubt is loud—it feels like I’m just treading water.

It’s like I trust the idea that things can get better, just not fully confident that I have what it takes to get there. If that makes sense?\n\nSo I go back and forth. I want to believe in that better version of my life—and part of me does—but it’s fragile. Like any setback or bad day can make that vision flicker a bit. I try not to let it go completely though.
