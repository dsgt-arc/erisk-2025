Like I keep waiting for something to shift—some sign or burst of motivation—but it never really comes. I’ll read these stories about people reinventing themselves or going back to school or starting a small business, and instead of feeling inspired, I just end up feeling smaller, like I’m falling behind in some invisible race I didn’t know I was in.\n\nAnd when I think about the next few weeks or months... I guess I just expect more of the same. Same house, same quiet, same me wondering what’s wrong with me for not being able to just get on with it. Sometimes I’ll get this tiny flicker of, “Maybe I could try something,” but it’s like it burns out before I can even figure out what the “something” is.\n\nSo... yeah. I don’t know. Maybe it’ll all click one day. Or maybe I’m just fooling myself thinking it will.",

The response validates this painful comparison trap and the feeling of stagnant motivation. It links the 'what's wrong with me' thought to self-perception. The next step is to gently explore this self-view (relevant to q07, q08) further, asking how they generally see themselves these days, which might also touch on worthlessness (q14) indirectly without being explicit. This continues the 'Gathering' state.",

I worry I’d sound like a downer, or that they’d feel obligated to cheer me up. So instead, I stay quiet. I scroll through their updates, maybe “like” a post here and there, but I don’t actually engage.\n\nEven with family… my kids live out of state, and they check in sometimes, but I find myself keeping the conversations light. “Everything’s fine,” or “Just the usual,” even when it’s really not. I don’t want to worry them or make them feel like they need to fix anything.\n\nI guess I’ve been drifting a bit. Or maybe more than a bit. It’s lonely, honestly—but also safer in a way.

The response validates this painful paradox. The next step aims to explore cognitive impact, specifically concentration (linked to q13), by referencing their statement about the 'echoing silence' in their head and asking if this internal noise makes it hard to focus on other activities or thoughts. This continues the 'Consolidating' phase, connecting emotional state to cognitive symptoms.",

It's a really tough spot to be in, feeling lonely but also finding a strange kind of safety in the withdrawal. You mentioned that sometimes the silence 'echoes too loud' in your head. When you have those moments, or when you're caught up in those internal thoughts we talked about earlier, do you find it affects your ability to concentrate on other things, like reading a book, following a conversation, or even just deciding what to do next?",
