Sometimes just changing the mental channel helps!\n\nWith all that going on – the muted enjoyment sometimes, the brain tiredness, and the effort it takes to make decisions – have you noticed if it impacts how you feel about connecting with friends or family?

That gap between knowing you’re doing your best and feeling like it’s not enough can be so sneaky. It doesn’t shout—it just kind of hums in the background.\n\nAs for the future... it’s mostly hopeful, I’d say. The wedding, life beyond that—it does feel like something I’m looking forward to. I catch myself daydreaming about little things like setting up a home together or planning future trips, and those moments feel bright. ✨\n\nBut yeah, the fog can definitely creep in sometimes, especially when I start wondering things like, “Am I going to keep feeling this way?” or “What if I can’t get the spark back?” It’s not a constant worry, but it pops up now and then, especially on quieter days. Like, will I be able to fully enjoy these milestones if I’m feeling kind of muted inside?\n\nI try to remind myself that this is just a phase, and not the whole story. The joy is still there—I’ve seen it peek through. It just might need a bit more nurturing right now.\n\nDo you think it’s normal to feel a little uncertain about the future even when you’re excited for it?",

And holding onto those bright moments, like daydreaming about your future home or trips, sounds like a wonderful anchor when the fogginess creeps in.

Big life changes, even happy ones like a wedding, naturally bring a mix of knowns and unknowns. It makes sense that some questions would pop up.\n\nWe've talked about energy levels, sleep, and that 'muted' feeling... I'm curious if you've noticed any changes in other physical rhythms lately?

It’s reassuring to know that even good changes can come with a side of “hmm... what’s this feeling?” I think sometimes we expect happiness to be this loud, constant thing, but in reality it kind of ebbs and flows, right?\n\nAs for physical rhythms... my appetite’s been pretty steady, actually. I’m still enjoying food—especially when I try a new recipe and it turns out well (those little wins feel extra nice lately 😄). If anything, I think I’ve leaned into cooking as a comfort thing. It gives me a sense of control and creativity, which helps balance out the unpredictability of wedding planning and, well, feelings.\n\nThat said, I have noticed that when I’m feeling overwhelmed or in that “brain tired” mode, I’m more likely to snack out of habit instead of hunger. Like, it’s less about the food and more about needing a break or something soothing. Not a huge shift, just one of those subtle patterns I’ve picked up on.\n\nDo you think that kind of shift—eating more for comfort than hunger—is something to pay attention to, or just a natural coping thing sometimes?",

Those little wins really do make a difference.\n\nAnd regarding the snacking – it sounds like you have good insight into it, noticing it's more about soothing or needing a break than actual hunger. Many people find themselves doing similar things as a way to cope with feeling overwhelmed or tired; it can definitely be a natural response sometimes.\n\nIt sounds like, weaving together what we've chatted about, you're navigating this phase with wedding planning excitement mixed with a feeling of muted enjoyment, some 'brain tiredness' and evening fatigue, sleep that gets disrupted by overthinking, occasional sluggishness with decisions or focus, finding socializing a bit more effortful, and dealing with a subtle inner critic, all while holding onto hope for the future.
