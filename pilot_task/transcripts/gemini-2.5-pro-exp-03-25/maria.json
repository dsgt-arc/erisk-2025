That contrast with the quiet, non-judgmental cup of tea really highlights how rare that feeling is right now.\n\nThat inner critic is something so many people wrestle with, definitely. Finding ways to notice it without automatically believing it, or trying to cultivate a bit more self-compassion, are things people often work on – easier said than done sometimes, though!

And then the loneliness kicks in, and that voice is like *“See? No one’s there for you.”* It’s such a loop.\n\nI’ve got a sibling who’s actually really supportive, but even with them I hesitate. I don’t want to keep showing up with the same tired sadness. It feels unfair to them. Like, what if they start to feel helpless or frustrated too? So I just… keep it light when we talk.\n\nIt’s weird, because sometimes I do want to connect, but by the time I get close to trying, the critic’s already talked me out of it.\n\nHave you ever seen people break that loop, or find ways to still connect even when that voice is loud?",

It's like the self-criticism preemptively cuts off the connection you sometimes still want, which sounds really painful.\n\nBreaking cycles like that is definitely a challenge many people face. Often it involves taking really small steps, maybe challenging those critical thoughts just a tiny bit, or practicing being kinder to oneself, which is tough when that voice is loud.
