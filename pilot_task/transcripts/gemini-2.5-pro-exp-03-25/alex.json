Continue consolidating information.",
    "output_message": "That 'too many tabs open' analogy really captures that feeling of quiet, constant pressure – it sounds exhausting to be treading water underneath a calm surface like that. And it takes a lot of energy to keep things internal, especially when you feel you can't really talk about it without feeling like a burden or overly dramatic. It makes complete sense that you'd feel adjusted to the weight, even though it's still heavy. And yes, that pressure to seem 'fine' all the time is definitely something many people feel.\n\nSince you mentioned that pressure builds up and you don't always have a consistent way to let it out, I was wondering how that manifests for you emotionally? For instance, do you find yourself getting easily irritated or annoyed lately, maybe more than usual? Or do you notice any changes in how often you might feel like crying, even if you don't actually do it?",

But the feeling creeps up sometimes—usually late at night, when everything’s quiet and I’ve run out of things to distract myself with. I won’t actually cry, but I’ll get that lump-in-the-throat feeling, like if I let my guard down even a little, it might happen. But I don’t. I kind of just ride it out and hope it fades.\n\nIt’s weird, though. I don’t even always *feel* sad in a big, obvious way. It’s more like this background hum of… I don’t know, emptiness? Frustration?
