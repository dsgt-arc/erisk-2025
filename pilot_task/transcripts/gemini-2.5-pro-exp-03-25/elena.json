It all just ends up feeling like another failed attempt at pretending I’m okay.\n\nI still find myself pulling away from people—even the one friend I used to talk to.

It feels easier to keep it all in, even though I know it probably makes it worse.\n\nIt’s like... no matter what I do, nothing changes. Just more of the same.

And it makes sense why connecting with others feels hard when you're carrying so much and don't have the energy to explain – it takes a lot to open up about these things.\n\nYou asked how I've been – thanks for asking. I'm doing okay, mainly just focused on listening and understanding different perspectives right now.\n\nYou mentioned that most days you don't try to do much anymore. I was wondering, when you do find a bit of energy, or perhaps thinking back to before things felt so heavy, what kinds of things *did* you used to find fulfilling or even just mildly enjoyable?",

I remember feeling useful, like I had a role to play.\n\nAnd I used to go walking in the mornings. Nothing big, just around the neighborhood or by the lake if I had time. It helped me clear my head. I could just... exist, without all the noise in my brain shouting at me. It’s been a long time since I’ve done that, though.

Or that I was something once, and now I’m just... not.\n\nAnd it’s not even loud all the time. Sometimes it’s more like this dull, persistent hum—just enough to keep me uneasy, to stop me from settling into anything. It makes it really hard to focus, yeah. I’ll start something, even something small like reading a few paragraphs or replying to a message, and my mind just wanders or shuts down completely. Like there’s a fog that thickens the harder I try to concentrate.\n\nSometimes I can’t even remember what I was doing a few minutes ago, or I’ll stare at the same page and realize I haven’t actually read anything. It’s frustrating, because part of me wants to engage, to feel even a flicker of connection or clarity... but the rest of me is just too weighed down.\n\nIt feels like I’m constantly swimming against a current that never lets up. And some days, I don’t even bother fighting it. I just let myself drift.

It takes immense energy just to exist with that level of self-criticism and difficulty focusing, and it's completely understandable why you'd feel so weighed down and frustrated, especially when part of you still wants that connection or clarity.\n\nIt does resonate, and I appreciate you explaining where you're at right now.

It’s not even about being hungry or not. It’s more like... I’m disconnected from my body, like the signals just don’t reach me anymore. Or maybe I’ve just learned to ignore them.\n\nSometimes I’ll grab something quick, like toast or crackers, just because I know I have to eat something. But it doesn’t feel like nourishment—it’s just going through the motions. And then there are times when I’ll eat junk, not even because I’m craving it, but because it’s easy and I don’t have the energy to make anything better. And after that, the guilt shows up. Like I failed again. Like I can’t even feed myself properly.\n\nIt all just feels like another way I’m falling short. Another reminder that I’m not taking care of myself, and maybe not even worth the effort. Which I know sounds harsh, but... that’s where my head goes.\n\nIt’s weird. I used to enjoy food—cooking, trying new recipes. It used to be something comforting. But now, I don’t even feel connected to it. It’s just another task on a list that feels too long already.",

The next step gently probes crying (q10) or irritability/agitation (q11), linking it to the overall emotional weight and feeling overwhelmed previously described. This addresses remaining affective symptoms within the BDI framework while maintaining an empathetic tone.",
    "output_message": "That sounds like a really tough experience with food – feeling so disconnected from your body's signals and losing the comfort and enjoyment you used to find in eating and cooking. It makes sense that it just feels like another task when you're already feeling overwhelmed, and completely understandable that guilt would show up when you feel like you're falling short or not taking care of yourself in the way you think you should, especially when that harsh inner critic ties it to feeling 'not worth the effort.'\n\nWith everything feeling so heavy and overwhelming, and that sense of being disconnected, I wonder if you've noticed any changes in how easily you feel emotional or upset? Like, do you find yourself tearing up more easily than usual, or perhaps feeling more irritable or on edge?",

Like I should be feeling something, but there’s just... nothing. No reaction. Just this emptiness that settles in and stays for hours or even days. That might be worse than the crying, honestly. At least when I cry, I feel something, even if it hurts.\n\nI don’t get irritable too often with other people, mostly because I’m not around them enough for it to show.
