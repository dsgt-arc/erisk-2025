It sounds incredibly harsh to be battling thoughts like 'What's wrong with me?' or feeling like you're failing at basics, lazy, or weak. That fear of letting people down or not living up to expectations adds another heavy layer. It makes complete sense how trying to push through, only to struggle more, just makes those thoughts pile on and feel worse, like getting caught in a spiral where looking for answers just leads to feeling heavier.\n\nWe've talked about quite a few interconnected things – the low energy and fatigue, the difficulty focusing, the sleep disruption, the way interacting with others can feel effortful, the frustration with yourself and those tough thoughts about falling short, and the uncertainty about things changing. Thinking about all these pieces tangled together, how would you describe the overall feeling of navigating your days lately?",

There are moments where I can see a little bit of something ahead, but most of the time it’s just blurry and hard to get a clear direction. Even when I know what I should be doing, it feels like I can’t get the energy to move toward it. So I just keep going, even though everything feels heavier and slower than it should.\n\nIt’s like I’m on autopilot a lot of the time—doing the basic things I need to do, but not really feeling in them, just getting through them. There’s a lot of mental noise, like I'm constantly trying to quiet all the thoughts or to-do lists that pop up, but it’s exhausting, and I’m not really sure where the end point is. Everything feels like it takes more effort than it should, and even when I try to get out of that headspace, I’m still carrying it with me.\n\nI guess that’s what it feels like—kind of numb in some ways, but also overloaded. Like my brain’s moving in slow motion but trying to keep up with everything around me. It’s tiring. I want to feel more present, but it’s like there’s this gap between where I am and where I want to be, and that gap feels wide some days. Does that make sense?",
