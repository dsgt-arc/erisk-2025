It makes me feel even more disconnected—like maybe I really am just too much.\n\nSo it… it means something that you’re still here, just listening. Not rushing to make it better, not turning away. Just hearing me. I don’t know if that changes anything, but in this moment, it feels a little less lonely. And I guess that’s something.",
