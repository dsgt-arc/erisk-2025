The guilt after I’ve snapped at someone just adds to the weight, and I get stuck in this cycle of feeling like I’m not being the person I want to be. I’m sure they can feel it too, and that just makes it worse because I don’t want to be that person—the one who’s always too tired, too irritable, or too distant.\n\nDeep down… I think I feel really lost. Like I’m not sure who I am anymore, or where I fit into everything. I used to feel more confident, like I had my place in the world, but now it feels like I’m just stumbling through, barely holding it all together. I want to be more present for my family, to enjoy the moments we share, but I often feel like I’m not really there—like I’m fading into the background of my own life. It’s hard to put into words, but it feels like I'm not enough in any of the roles I have. Not as a mom, not as a partner, not even for myself.\n\nAnd then, in those quiet moments, when the noise of the day fades, I just feel… empty. Like I don’t have much left to give, and that scares me. It’s that deep-down feeling of being stuck in a version of myself I don’t recognize, and not knowing how to get back to the person I used to be.\n\nI think that’s what makes it feel so heavy, so relentless. I just want to find my way out of this, but it’s hard to even know where to start. Does any of that resonate with you? Or have you felt that sense of being lost at times, like the person you once were is slipping away?",

It sounds incredibly painful and scary to feel so lost and empty, like you're fading or disconnected from the person you used to be and the life around you.

And yes, that sense of being lost or feeling a past self slip away is something many people grapple with at difficult times; you're definitely not alone in feeling that way, though it sounds particularly heavy for you right now.\n\nWe've talked about quite a lot – the heavy fatigue and mental fog, the irritability and lack of buffer, the difficulty sleeping and changes in appetite, the struggle to connect with family and enjoy things, and now this deep feeling of being lost, empty, and stuck. It paints a picture of someone carrying an immense weight and feeling profoundly distressed. It makes complete sense why it feels relentless and why finding a starting point feels so hard.
