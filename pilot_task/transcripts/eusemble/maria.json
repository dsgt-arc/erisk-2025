To have a day where I don’t feel like I’m just trying to get through it.\n\nBut if I’m honest… another part of me doesn’t really believe it’s possible. Or maybe I’m just scared to hope for it. I’ve had moments where I thought I was getting better, like something shifted slightly, but it never seems to stick. And when things fall back into the same pattern, it feels worse somehow—like I failed at feeling better.\n\nSo I guess I feel kind of stuck between wanting change and not really being able to picture it lasting. It’s like I’m holding my breath for something different but too tired to reach for it anymore.\n\nStill, I guess the fact that I think about change at all means something, right?

It sounds exhausting to be holding your breath like that, wanting something different but feeling too worn out to reach.\n\nYou're right, though – the fact that a part of you still thinks about change, still wonders what 'lighter' might feel like, is definitely significant. It speaks to a resilience that's still there, even under all that weight.\n\nAnd to answer your question directly – yes, absolutely. It is possible for things to shift, for the fog to lift, even when someone has felt stuck for a long time.
