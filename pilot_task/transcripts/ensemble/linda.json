I’ve been feeling this heaviness in my chest lately—not sharp pain, more like pressure, like I’m carrying something that won’t lift. My shoulders and neck are always tense too, probably from how much I’ve been clenching without realizing it.\n\nSome days my whole body just feels sluggish, like I’m wading through something thick. And I get headaches more often now, especially in the afternoons. I keep wondering if it’s stress or just being so run-down, but it’s hard to separate it all out. I used to be a lot more in tune with my body—knew what I needed, when I needed rest or movement—but now it’s like I don’t even recognize it sometimes.\n\nAnd honestly... I’ve been avoiding mirrors. I catch a glimpse and barely recognize myself. I don’t know if it’s age, or stress, or just seeing someone who looks as tired on the outside as I feel on the inside. It’s hard to feel comfortable in your own skin when it feels like everything—inside and out—is unraveling a bit.\n\nHave you ever had those days where your body just doesn’t feel like it belongs to you anymore?",
