I make plans sometimes, but when the day comes, I feel too drained to actually go. I know seeing people can help, but the thought of it just feels like too much a lot of the time. Quieter things, like a one-on-one coffee, seem a little more manageable though.\n\nSleep’s been inconsistent too—either I can’t fall asleep, or I wake up still feeling tired. I’ve been trying to cut back on screen time at night and read instead, just to see if that helps.\n\nBut yeah… overall, I guess I’m just getting by. Not terrible, but not great either.

I don’t know… maybe it’s just about keeping things going without expecting some big change overnight.\n\nIt’s hard to picture what the next few months look like, honestly.
