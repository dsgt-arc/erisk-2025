Like if nothing changes, I’m going to be stuck in this loop forever, and I’m not sure how long I can keep doing that.\n\nThere’s a part of me that wants to believe it’ll get better. That maybe I’ll catch a break, or something will click, and I’ll feel more like myself again. But right now, that hope feels kind of distant—like a light at the end of a tunnel I’m not even sure I’m moving through.\n\nAnd I hate admitting that out loud. I’m supposed to have it together. I’ve got a job, a family… I should be grateful, right? I tell myself that all the time. But it doesn’t change how drained I feel.\n\nI don’t know… maybe something will shift.

I don’t always show it, but I feel the irritation building fast.\n\nAnd with my family... I hate to say it, but I catch myself being short sometimes. Not in a yelling kind of way, but just… cold. Distant. Like I can’t muster the energy to respond warmly. And then that guilt sets in, because I know they don’t deserve that. They just want to talk, or share something, and I’m over here acting like they’re pulling me away from some mission-critical thing when really I’m just… fried.\n\nIt’s like everything takes more emotional bandwidth than I have to give. Even good things can feel overwhelming when I’m running this low.\n\nI used to be the calm one—steady, reliable. Lately, I feel like I’m just trying not to come apart at the seams.",

Acknowledge the contrast with their past self ('calm one'). Shift to a consolidating phase by summarizing the key themes heard across the conversation (fatigue, lack of enjoyment/energy, self-criticism, difficulty with decisions/focus, irritability, pessimism) to ensure understanding and offer a space for reflection or correction. This helps confirm the assessment before potentially concluding.",

It makes sense that when you're feeling so 'fried' and emotionally drained, even simple interactions can feel like too much, leading to that distant feeling and then the guilt afterwards. It's a really difficult cycle.\n\nListening to you, it sounds like there's this pervasive sense of fatigue and low energy running through everything, making it hard to enjoy things or even get through tasks without immense effort. And alongside that, there seems to be a lot of self-criticism, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feeling quite pessimistic about things shifting, and now this increased irritability too.
