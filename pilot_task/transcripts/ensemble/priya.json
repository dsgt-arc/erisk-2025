I do try to stay connected, like sending a quick message or hopping on a call with a friend when I can, but it’s definitely less frequent than before. Sometimes I catch myself pulling back a bit, even when I miss them, just because I don't want to sound like I'm venting all the time about wedding stuff or feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBut whenever I do chat with someone, I always feel better after. It’s just that initial “ugh, do I really want to talk right now?” that I have to push through. I’m trying to be better about that, even if it’s just sharing the small stuff or sending a meme to keep the connection going. 😄\n\nDo you ever get like that—where you know reaching out would help, but it feels like too much in the moment?",
