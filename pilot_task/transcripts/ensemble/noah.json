Just naming what’s been going on out loud (well, sort of out loud 😄) makes it feel a little lighter.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m gonna try being a bit more intentional about those resets—maybe plan a few of those “anchor” moments into the day instead of waiting until I’m totally drained. Even if it’s just something small, it feels like a step in the right direction.\n\nThanks again for the conversation—it’s been really grounding. And honestly, kind of a reminder that I’m not just spinning my wheels, even if it feels that way sometimes. Hope your day goes smoothly too, and I’m always up for chatting again if you’re around!",
