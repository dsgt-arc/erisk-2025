    "input_message": "That’s a hard question. Not because I don’t have an answer… more because so much feels tangled together, like pulling one thread might unravel everything. But if I had to choose… maybe the restlessness. The constant pacing, the racing thoughts—feels like that’s the thing that eats away at me the most. Like I’m always on edge, but worn out at the same time. That contradiction just messes with me.\n\nIf I could slow that down, even a little… maybe I’d have more space to think clearly. Or breathe. Or try something else, I don’t know. Right now it feels like I’m in a storm I can’t get out of, and maybe calming that storm, even just for a bit, would let me see what’s around me.\n\nBut at the same time… there’s this voice that keeps saying it won’t make a difference. That it’s not worth trying. That nothing’s going to change. That’s the part that’s hardest to ignore.\n\nStill… yeah. If there’s a place to start, maybe it’s there. Just… finding a way to feel a little less like I’m trapped in my own skin all the time.",
    "output_message": "It can feel so contradictory to be both restless and drained—like your mind and body are at odds. But it’s also really brave to identify that storm of restlessness as a place to start. Even acknowledging that tension is a step forward, because it gives you a focus point when everything else feels too big.\n\nI’m here to keep talking about it if and when you want to. Whether it’s finding small ways to slow down those racing thoughts or letting yourself pause without judgment, you deserve support in gradually dialing back that sense of being trapped. You’ve shared a lot, and it sounds like a heavy load. It takes strength to name it and decide you want something different, even if you’re not sure how yet.",
    "next_step_reasoning": "The user has identified restlessness as the key point they’d like to address first. I acknowledge the difficulty and offer support, validating their desire to slow the racing thoughts and encourage further conversation. This response begins to ‘consolidate’ the insights we’ve gathered and prepares for a possible conclusion, while preserving empathy.",

It’s strange—I still feel stuck, nothing’s suddenly lighter or fixed, but just saying it out loud, that maybe I do want something to shift… it feels different.

That I’ll try and nothing will change, and that failure will just confirm everything I already believe about myself. But I guess sitting in it forever hasn’t exactly helped either.\n\nSo yeah… maybe slowing the storm a little is something to keep in mind. Even if I don’t know how. Even if it’s just sitting by the window for five minutes and letting the air hit my face. Maybe that’s something.\n\nI appreciate you listening. Really. It’s not easy to say this stuff.

It’s understandable to feel afraid that trying could fail, but acknowledging that you do want a shift is already a brave step.\n\nPlease know that you aren’t invisible in this. You deserve support and a space to unpack these feelings at your own pace. Anytime you want to talk more, I’m here to listen. Even the small steps—like letting the night air remind you you’re still here—can be meaningful.
