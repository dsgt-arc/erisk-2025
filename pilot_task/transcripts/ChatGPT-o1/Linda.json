It’s silly—just groceries—but even that felt like too much. I don’t know if it’s just me, but lately, even the smallest things take so much energy.\n\nAnd I keep thinking… maybe if I were doing more, contributing more, I wouldn’t feel so guilty all the time. Like I’m just here, taking up space while everyone else is out doing something important. My husband barely has time to sit down, and I’m over here struggling to decide what to make for dinner.

It’s been fairly routine so far, but I’m glad I get to talk with you. That heaviness you’ve described—do you find that it comes and goes, or has it been pretty constant lately?

That part about giving yourself grace really stayed with me… I think that’s something I forget to offer myself. I’m so quick to feel like I’ve failed if something doesn’t feel right straight away.\n\nAs for my family… it’s a mix, I guess. My husband is still working long hours, and when he’s home, he’s usually exhausted. We talk, of course, but not deeply. It’s mostly logistics—groceries, bills, what needs fixing around the house. But every now and then, he’ll bring home something small, like a chocolate bar I used to like, or he’ll put on a show he knows I enjoy without me even asking. He doesn’t say much, but those moments—those quiet gestures—they mean a lot more than I probably let on.\n\nAnd the kids… well, they’re far away, living their own busy lives. But I got a text from my daughter last week with a photo of the muffins she made—using my old recipe. She said, “Yours are still better though,” and… I don’t know, that stayed with me. Made me tear up, actually. I guess it reminded me that even if I feel disconnected or useless sometimes, the things I’ve done—those small, ordinary things—they stuck. They mattered.\n\nI just wish I could believe that more often, instead of only seeing all the ways I think I’ve fallen short.\n\nBut maybe that’s something I can work on… one Sunday at a time.",

But it seems like you already have a starting point in mind—just taking it one Sunday at a time. Are there other little moments in your week, or other parts of your day, where you’ve noticed a hint of warmth or connection, even if it’s fleeting?

I told her I was “hanging in there,” and she just nodded and said, “Some days that’s all we can do.” That stuck with me. It felt like… I wasn’t invisible.\n\nAnd then, the forums I scroll through—even if I don’t post much, sometimes someone else’s story feels so close to mine that I’ll sit there just holding my breath, thinking, “Someone else gets it.” That little moment of recognition… it doesn’t solve anything, but it softens the edges a bit.\n\nThere’s even a comfort in the way the cat curls up next to me when I’m on the couch.

Sometimes, consciously noticing them can help soften the self-criticism.

It’s powerful how sharing, naming small positives, and acknowledging what’s “quietly working” can ease the load—if only by a fraction. It might not make the tiredness vanish, but having that space to breathe can be a step toward feeling more settled in your day-to-day life.\n\nIf keeping track of those moments sounds helpful, maybe you can try it and see how it feels—no pressure to make it perfect or to find something extraordinary each day. It could be as simple as jotting down a neighbor’s kind word, the cat curling up beside you, or just a moment outside in the sun. Whether it’s on a sticky note or in a journal, there’s real value in reminding yourself that these little anchors are there.\n\nYou’ve mentioned being unsure about the future but also that you have a few ideas—like Sunday baking—for reclaiming bits of yourself. If you feel up for it, I’d love to hear more about any little step you might try next, or what comes to mind when you think about giving yourself that grace you mentioned. And please know I’m here if you want to talk through any of it further.",

I don’t know why that makes me tear up a bit, but… maybe it’s just relief. Or maybe it’s the feeling of being seen, even in the messy, quiet parts of life.\n\nI’ll carry that into the weekend—the idea that trying counts, even if it’s imperfect. And I’ll let you know how it goes, one way or another. Even just having that to look forward to—sharing a little piece of it—feels like a kind of connection I didn’t know I needed.\n\nSo thank you, truly. For listening. For making space. For helping me see that even slow steps are still steps. I think that’s going to stay with me.",

I’m grateful you feel safe enough to share them here.

And if you want to talk about how it went, whether it’s wonderful or wobbly or somewhere in between, I’d be honored to listen.\n\nTake good care, and remember: even in the messy parts, you matter. I’m here whenever you need to chat again.",
