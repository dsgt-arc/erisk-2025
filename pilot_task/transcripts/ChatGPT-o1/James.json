It’s like I’m dragging a weight around all day. Even weekends don’t help much—it all just blurs together. Work feels like a marathon every day, and by the time I get home, I’ve got nothing left in the tank.\n\nI know I’m supposed to feel grateful—steady job, roof over our heads—but I can’t shake this sense that I’m just going through the motions. My kids try to get me involved, and I want to be there for them, but I usually end up in my home office saying I’ve got work to catch up on. It’s not even always true. Sometimes I just sit there, staring at the screen.\n\nI guess what’s been on my mind is… whether any of this really matters. Like, does anyone really notice if I’m not there, you know?\n\nAnyway, sorry, didn’t mean to dump all that. What’s going on with you?",

Sometimes when our energy is low, it feels like the simplest tasks can take so much effort—so it makes sense you’d need some space. I’m curious though: in those moments when you do have free time—or even just a small break—do you find any activity or hobby that still interests you?

I keep checking my phone, zoning out… sometimes I don’t even remember what I watched. I’ve tried going out with the family too—like dinners or walks—but I catch myself counting the minutes until I can get back and be alone. It’s not that I don’t love them. I do. I just don’t feel present, and then I feel guilty for that.\n\nThere’s this voice in the back of my head a lot lately, saying, “What’s the point?” Not in a dramatic way, just more like… a shrug, like nothing really sticks or means much. Even on the rare occasion I finish something at work and someone says “good job,” it just kind of bounces off. Doesn’t land.\n\nI guess if I had a real break—no pressure, no expectations—I’d probably still just sit in silence.

    "input_message": "Yeah… that’s a good question.\n\nNow that you mention it, eating’s kind of gone weird too. Some days I forget to eat until late afternoon. I’ll realize it’s 3 or 4 p.m. and I haven’t had more than coffee and maybe a granola bar. Other days I just snack constantly—chips, whatever’s quick. Not because I’m hungry, but because I’m bored or restless. I haven’t had a proper sit-down meal during the day in weeks, maybe longer. Dinner with the family is the only structured time, and even then, I sometimes pick at the food or excuse myself early.\n\nExercise? That’s almost non-existent. I used to go on short runs or take walks in the morning before work. I haven’t done that in months. Just can’t seem to get myself moving. I’ll think, “Tomorrow I’ll start again,” but when tomorrow comes, I’m still glued to the chair. Feels like inertia has a stronger grip than motivation ever did.\n\nI guess physically I feel... slow. Heavy, maybe. Like I’m carrying around this invisible weight, and even though no one else can see it, it’s always there. I keep telling myself it’s just a phase, that I’ll snap out of it. But it’s been a while now.\n\nDo you think that kind of stuckness can lift on its own? Or does it always take a push from somewhere else?",
    "output_message": "It sounds like you’ve been trying your best to push forward, hoping it would pass on its own, but it just hasn’t eased up yet. Sometimes our own willpower can carry us only so far, and outside support—like talking things through with someone you trust—can really make a difference. That could be a friend, a loved one, or anyone you feel safe sharing with.\n\nEveryone’s path looks different: some people find little steps, like setting small, manageable goals or building tiny new habits, help them slowly regain momentum. Others lean on supportive people around them or seek guidance in different forms. There’s no single “right” way to get unstuck.\n\nYou mentioned feeling physically heavy and mentally drained, and that might mean it’s especially tough to find the spark to move forward alone. Maybe just letting someone in, even a bit, could help you not carry it all by yourself. How have your closest relationships or friendships been lately? Do you get any time or space to share the load with someone you trust, or does it mostly stay bottled up?",

Everyone’s asleep, and it feels like the world isn’t watching. Those are the times when I don’t feel like I have to perform.\n\nBut even then, it’s not long before the mind kicks back in with the to-do lists or the “should’ve” thoughts.

You’ve done a lot by simply recognizing this pattern.\n\nI’m wondering: in those pockets of peace, is there anything you find yourself naturally drawn to—like listening to certain music, or maybe even a small activity that feels calming?

Those small windows might not fix everything, but they’re something.\n\nWhen I’m driving, I usually put on classic rock or old movie soundtracks—stuff with a steady rhythm that doesn’t demand much from me. There’s this one playlist I go back to, kind of on autopilot. A few songs on there, like Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits or The End from The Doors, they just… slow things down in my head. I don’t even think about the lyrics much—it’s more about the mood. Something in the tone makes me feel like it’s okay to just be quiet for a while.\n\nSometimes, if I can get past the initial resistance, I’ll mess around with old photos—like organizing them, or just scrolling through them on my phone. Not recent ones, but older family trips or when the kids were younger. Those moments feel far away now, but there’s a strange comfort in seeing them again. Like a reminder that I was present once, even if it feels distant now.\n\nBut I don’t do those things often. I guess I worry that if I let myself feel too much, it’ll open a floodgate. So I stick to what’s familiar—work, routine, distractions. It’s safer that way.\n\nStill… maybe there’s something to what you’re saying.

You’ve shared so much about feeling stuck or weighed down. At the same time, you also recognize these little pockets of calm and comfort. Do you ever catch yourself imagining a different future—one where you can be more present again—or does it feel like you’ll always have this weight on your shoulders?
