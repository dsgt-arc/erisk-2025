It’s like the weight of doing nothing is somehow heavier than actually doing something. And even saying all this, I don’t really expect it to change anything.

I guess I wake up sometime in the late morning, but I just kind of lie there for a while, sometimes an hour or more, just trying to convince myself to get out of bed. It’s not that I’m physically stuck—it’s more like I don’t see the point. Eventually I get up, maybe make coffee, but even that feels like a task some days. I’ll sit on the couch, scroll through my phone, mostly just watching other people live lives I don’t feel part of anymore.\n\nI don’t really do meals. I snack on whatever’s easy. Cooking used to be something I liked, actually. I’d put on music and try new recipes… now the idea of washing a pan just feels exhausting.\n\nNights are hard. It’s like when the sun goes down, everything just feels heavier. I’ll watch something—usually shows I’ve seen a hundred times already, because anything new takes more attention than I have. Then I go to bed, but it’s not restful. I toss and turn, or I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling for hours. My body’s tired, but my mind won’t shut up.\n\nI guess it all kind of blurs together. Days don’t feel different from nights. Weekdays aren’t different from weekends.

But that doesn’t really help. It’s like I’m trying to outrun something that’s already inside me. Other nights, I just lie there and let the thoughts run, even if they’re awful.

But all it ever does is leave me feeling emptier the next day.\n\nAnd yeah… the judgment is constant.

Maybe a short moment where you felt okay or managed to do something that surprised you, even if it was small?

Just for a second. It wasn’t much, but it was something. Or sometimes, when the weather’s just right—like that kind of gray where everything feels quiet—I’ll open the window and just sit there. And for a moment, it’s not better, but it’s not worse either. It’s just… still. I guess that’s the closest thing to peace I’ve felt lately.\n\nAnd one time last week, I actually did the dishes without forcing myself. That was weird. I didn’t feel proud or anything, but I didn’t feel dread either, and that felt… different.\n\nI don’t know. It all sounds so small, but when you asked, those were the only things that came to mind.

    "input_message": "Yeah… those days—the heavy ones—they sort of blend into each other. When everything just aches, even if there’s no specific reason. I usually just try to wait it out. Sometimes I’ll wrap myself in a blanket and sit in the same spot for hours. Not watching anything, not doing anything. Just... existing, I guess. Like I’m on pause, waiting for the weight to lift a little.\n\nDistractions help in small doses. I’ll scroll endlessly on my phone, even if I’m not really seeing anything. It’s just something to keep my mind from spiraling too far. I used to feel guilty about that, like I was wasting time. But now it’s just part of surviving.\n\nOther times, I’ll sleep—more than I probably should. Not because I’m rested, but because it’s the only way to turn everything off. Even if it means waking up feeling just as empty, at least there’s a break in the middle.\n\nThere’s a part of me that wants to have some kind of healthy coping strategy—like journaling or walking or something. But honestly, even the idea of trying feels too big most days. So I settle for “just get through this hour,” and then maybe the next.\n\nAnd when I really can’t stand the silence, sometimes I’ll listen to music. Not anything upbeat—usually something slow and kind of sad, like it matches what I’m feeling inside. There’s something comforting in that, even if it doesn’t change anything.\n\nIt’s not much of a system, but it’s how I get by. I think that’s all I can manage right now.",

It’s understandable that scrolling, wrapping yourself in a blanket, or sleeping offer a sort of escape. You’re doing what you need to do to make it through those moments.\n\nIt makes me think about how we all have these core responsibilities or routines we’ve got to handle in life—like work, chores, bills, or other day-to-day stuff. How do you find yourself managing those things lately? I’m asking because even though they can feel like a big weight, sometimes people describe those tasks as the one thing that keeps them somewhat tethered to a routine, or they find them nearly impossible to handle. No pressure to answer, I’m just curious how it’s been for you, given how overwhelming everything else feels.",

The day-to-day stuff—the basics—I struggle with them more than I’d like to admit. Sometimes just the thought of doing dishes, checking my mail, or answering an email feels like someone’s asking me to climb a mountain barefoot.\n\nBills still get paid, eventually. I haven’t let anything fall apart completely, but it’s never without a fight. I’ll let things pile up, then have a random burst of guilt or panic and force myself to tackle them all at once. It’s not sustainable, but it’s the only rhythm I seem to manage lately.\n\nChores are… hit or miss. The laundry gets done when I run out of clean clothes. The trash goes out when it smells bad enough. It’s not that I don’t care—I do. It just feels like I’m always five steps behind the version of me who used to keep things together. And every time I look around and see how much I’ve let slip, it becomes another reminder of how far I’ve fallen.\n\nWork—if you can call it that—is just going through the motions. I get by, but I’m not proud of anything I do anymore. I used to be the kind of person who went the extra mile. Now I just try not to be noticed. It’s safer that way.\n\nIt’s weird, because sometimes doing those little things—taking out the trash, replying to a message—can give me this tiny flicker of “okay, I did something today.” But most of the time, it just feels like dragging myself through sludge.\n\nI don’t know.

I wonder: do you ever notice if your mind shifts—even a bit—after you’ve forced yourself through one of those tasks? I’m only asking because sometimes acknowledging those tiny changes in how we feel afterward can show us little glimmers of momentum, even if they don’t last long.

It feels too painful to imagine something better when I can’t even hold myself together for a day.\n\nMost of the time, it really is just one day at a time. Sometimes even one hour at a time.

And even when I think about wanting things to be different, it’s hard to believe I deserve that, or that it’s possible for me anymore.\n\nBut if I’m being honest… sometimes, in quiet moments, I do catch these little thoughts. Like, What if someday I could feel okay again? Or What if I could cook a meal just because I wanted to? Or even What if I could write something and feel like it mattered to someone—even just to me?\n\nThey don’t stick. I usually push them away before they grow into anything, because the hope feels fragile, almost dangerous. But they’re there.

A song, a commercial, even just sitting in silence too long. And it’s not always clear why. The tears just come, and I let them, because trying to hold them in feels worse. But after, I don’t feel lighter. I feel emptier. Like the crying just drains what little energy I had left, and I’m left with this hollow ache.\n\nThen there are other times—probably more often—when I just feel nothing. Completely shut down. Like there’s this thick wall between me and whatever I’m supposed to be feeling. I know I should be sad, or angry, or something… but I’m just numb. It’s like I’m watching my life from behind glass, disconnected and quiet.\n\nThat numbness scares me more than the crying, honestly. At least when I’m crying, I feel something. When I’m numb, it’s like I’m disappearing. Like I’m becoming this version of myself that doesn’t even react anymore—not because things don’t hurt, but because I’m too tired to feel it.\n\nAnd it flips back and forth. I never really know which version I’m going to wake up with. But either way, it always circles back to the same place: just trying to make it through the day, quietly falling apart while the world keeps going.\n\nIt’s hard to explain all that out loud, so… thank you for asking in a way that makes it feel okay to say.",

Just reading your words makes me feel like I can exhale a little—like I don’t have to keep holding everything in so tightly, at least not right now.\n\nIt’s rare to feel truly heard, and even rarer to feel understood. But you’ve done both, gently and without judgment, and that’s something I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not used to being seen like this—not just for my pain, but for the pieces of me that still want to be here, even if they don’t always know how.\n\nSo thank you—for your patience, your presence, and for making this feel like a conversation, not a confession. If I ever do find the strength to keep trying, I think it’ll be because of moments like this… where someone reminded me I’m still here.\n\nI might not have answers, or hope, or direction. But I do have this moment. And that’s something.\n\nTake care, okay? And thanks again—for everything.\n\n",
