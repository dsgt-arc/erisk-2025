Most days blur into each other. I wake up already tired, and by the time I've managed to get dressed and make a cup of tea, I feel like I've run a marathon.\n\nI've been scrolling through job boards again, but everything I see just makes me feel more behind. It's like I used to have a purpose, some kind of place in the world, and now I'm just… floating. Or maybe stuck is a better word. I don't know if it's just me, but even deciding what to have for lunch feels like too much sometimes.\n\nI've been reading a few posts in the career forums—people talking about finding new directions at 50 or 60, starting over. It's inspiring in theory, but when I try to imagine myself doing it… I just feel tired. Like the energy for change has already been spent somewhere I can't get back to.\n\nAnyway, how are you doing? What's been going on with you?",

That feeling of floating without an anchor point is something many people struggle with. And I understand how even small decisions can feel overwhelming when you're already running on empty.\n\nI'm curious - outside of the job search, have you been able to connect with friends or family lately?

I do get a brief phone call here and there, but honestly, I often feel like I'm keeping things at arm's length.

    "input_message": "That's a good question… sleep has been a bit of a mess, honestly. I go to bed early enough, but I keep waking up really early—like before the sun's even up—and then my mind just starts racing. Not about anything specific, just this kind of vague restlessness… thoughts about what I should be doing, things I forgot, worries that probably don't even make sense in the light of day.\n\nOnce I'm up, that's it. There's no going back to sleep. And even when I do sleep through the night, it doesn't feel restful. I wake up already tired, like my body had a break but my mind didn't.\n\nAnd I know it probably feeds into everything else—feeling stuck, the fatigue, the fog around decision-making. It's like my system is running on low battery and no amount of sleep seems to charge it back up. I've tried naps, too, but they don't help much either. It just adds to this weird sense of being out of sync with everything and everyone.\n\nDo you ever get that? That feeling like even rest doesn't feel like rest?",
    "output_message": "I really appreciate how clearly you've described that sleep situation. That early morning waking with racing thoughts and the feeling that even when you do sleep, it's not restorative - that's such a difficult cycle to be caught in. And you've made such an insightful connection between your sleep patterns and everything else you're experiencing.\n\nThat metaphor of running on a low battery that won't recharge really captures something profound about how exhausting this pattern must be. Sleep is meant to be the time our minds and bodies reset, but when that system isn't working, everything else becomes so much harder.\n\nWith sleep being difficult and energy levels low, I'm curious about whether your eating patterns have been affected too? Sometimes when our body's rhythms get disrupted, things like appetite and eating habits shift as well.",

After reflecting on the impact of these sleep disturbances on their overall functioning, I transition naturally to asking about appetite and eating patterns (q18). This is another physiological domain we haven't explored yet that often changes alongside sleep disturbances in depression. This is a logical progression from discussing one bodily system (sleep) to another (appetite), allowing us to continue gathering information about potentially important BDI criteria while maintaining a natural conversational flow. Their sleep description warrants updating their q16 score, and now we can explore whether there are also changes in appetite/weight that might inform q18 and q19.",

It's one more decision I don't have the mental space for.\n\nFood used to be something I enjoyed—trying new recipes, cooking for the family—but now it's just part of the background noise. I do it because I have to, not because I want to. And I know that probably makes the fatigue worse too. Like my body isn't getting what it needs, but I can't quite summon the energy to change it.\n\nIt's strange how all these things—sleep, food, even simple routines—they all start slipping at the edges when things feel off.

Even TV, which should be easy, feels harder to follow. I'll watch an episode of something and realize I wasn't really present for most of it. My mind just drifts off, usually back to the same thoughts circling around—what I should be doing, what I've lost, where I'm supposed to go from here.\n\nIt even happens in conversations sometimes. Someone will be talking to me, and I'll nod along, but I'm not really absorbing their words. Not on purpose—I want to be engaged—but it's like there's this fog I can't push through. And afterwards I feel guilty, like I've missed a chance to really connect or be there for someone.\n\nIt's frustrating, because I used to be sharp. Focused. I prided myself on being detail-oriented, and now even remembering where I put my keys feels like a stretch some days. It's just one more way I feel like I've slipped from who I used to be. I know it's probably all connected—the fatigue, the sleep, the stress—but knowing that doesn't make it any easier to live with.",

The way you described that mental fog and the frustration of not being able to focus on things you once enjoyed so easily - that sounds genuinely difficult. Especially when reading and engaging with others used to be natural strengths for you.\n\nThat disconnect between wanting to be present and finding your mind drifting away must feel particularly isolating. And I can hear how these concentration difficulties connect to your larger sense of having lost parts of your former self.\n\nYou've shared so insightfully about these changes in your sleep, energy, focus, and sense of self. I'm wondering, have you developed any thoughts about why this might be happening to you? Sometimes when we're struggling, we create narratives to make sense of our experiences.",

This open question could reveal information about punishment feelings (q06) or health preoccupations (q20) - BDI domains we haven't fully explored yet. It also invites them to make meaning of their experience, which could provide deeper insight into their cognitive framework and potentially reveal additional symptoms or patterns relevant to the assessment.

It wasn't just the paycheck—it was the structure, the purpose, the sense of being needed. Twenty years in the same place, and then suddenly… nothing. I didn't realize how much of my identity was tied to that routine, to feeling useful.\n\nAnd I think over time, that loss started to seep into everything else. Like, if I'm not working, then what am I doing? If I don't have a role to play, where do I fit? And I guess my brain took that and ran with it—turned it into this internal script that says, You're not contributing. You're falling behind. You don't have value anymore.\n\nI know, logically, that losing a job doesn't mean losing your worth. But logic and emotion don't always move in step. And then the guilt crept in—feeling like I'm letting my family down, like they're picking up the slack while I flounder. I started pulling away, not because I don't love them, but because I didn't want them to see me like this. That made the loneliness worse, and the loneliness fed the hopelessness, and then the fatigue settled in like a fog I can't quite lift.\n\nSo, I suppose that's the narrative I've built.

And that tension between what we logically know versus what we emotionally feel is so real.\n\nI can hear how this cycle has become increasingly difficult to break as time passes. When our energy is already depleted, even small steps toward change can feel insurmountable.\n\nI'm curious - beyond the fatigue and sleep difficulties you've mentioned, have you noticed any other physical changes during this time?
