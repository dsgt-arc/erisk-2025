They're growing up so fast, and I'm just watching from the sidelines, too exhausted to jump in. It's not that I don't want to—I do. But wanting and being able to… they feel like two very different things lately.\n\nI miss feeling capable. I used to be the one with plans and energy and… light.

Now the thought of pulling out ingredients just feels… heavy.

Yet you still think about it, which does seem like an important signpost, as you put it.\n\nYou mentioned waking up tired earlier. I'm wondering about how your energy levels and sleep have been?

Even when I sleep through the night—on the rare nights that I do—I still wake up feeling like I haven't rested at all. Like I've been carrying weights in my sleep. It's frustrating because, from the outside, it probably just looks like I'm lazy or unmotivated, but inside, it feels like I'm trying to move through molasses.\n\nAnd the tiredness… it's not just physical. It's this deep, bone-level fatigue that makes even thinking about doing something exhausting. Like I'll look at a sink full of dishes and have to pep-talk myself just to turn on the water. It's embarrassing to admit that, honestly.\n\nSometimes I wonder if my body's just responding to all the things I've been holding in—like grief and guilt and… all the ways I feel like I'm falling short. Maybe sleep can't fix what emotional weight keeps piling on, you know?\n\nBut yeah… you're right. The fact that I still think about baking or listen to those songs—it does make me wonder if there's still a small part of me in there, waiting for a break in the fog.\n\nDo you ever feel like your mind and body are working against you when you need them most?",

And waking up already tired after a night's sleep must be incredibly frustrating.\n\nWhat you said about the emotional weight - the grief and guilt you've been holding in - that struck me. Would you feel comfortable sharing a bit more about that guilt? You mentioned feeling like you're falling short... I'm wondering in what ways you feel that, and if you find yourself being particularly hard on yourself about certain things?",

I'm now guiding the conversation toward exploring the emotional content they spontaneously introduced - specifically guilt and feelings of falling short, which aligns with BDI domains q05 (guilt) and q08 (self-criticalness). This is a natural progression from their mention of emotional weight contributing to their physical state. By asking about specific ways they feel they're falling short and whether they're hard on themselves, I can gather information about their self-perception and thought patterns while maintaining the conversational flow. This approach allows me to respectfully explore potential self-criticism without directly asking about depression.",

That voice sounds so convincing sometimes.\n\nThe guilt is… layered, I guess. I feel like I'm not the partner I used to be, not the parent I want to be. My partner works so hard, and I'm here, barely managing to keep the basics going. And the kids… I can see it in their eyes sometimes, like they miss who I used to be. I miss her too.\n\nI feel guilty for not being more present, for saying no when they ask me to do something simple like go for a walk or play a game. I know they understand, at least on some level, but I still feel like I'm letting them down. Like I'm watching life happen from the sidelines, and they're having to move on without me fully in it.\n\nAnd then there's the guilt about the guilt. Like—I know I'm struggling, I know it's not all in my control, but that doesn't stop the feeling that I'm somehow failing at being the person they need.\n\nI don't talk about this with them.

It takes tremendous strength to acknowledge those feelings without letting them completely overwhelm you.\n\nI'm wondering - when you look ahead, how do you see things unfolding?

I think, \"Why can't I just handle this like I used to?\" I never wanted to be the kind of person who pulls away or reacts out of exhaustion, but here I am.\n\nOther times, I feel completely numb—like even frustration doesn't get through. Someone could tell me something upsetting and I'd just sit there, blank, like I've run out of emotional bandwidth altogether.

It's like every system is sending the same message in different languages.\n\nWith the changes you've mentioned in appetite and eating patterns, have you noticed any shifts in your weight or how your clothes fit?

I don't weigh myself often, but I can feel the difference in how I move, how I carry myself. It's like this quiet reminder that I've let things slide… and then of course that spirals into more guilt.\n\nBut it's confusing, because I'm not even eating more, really. In fact, I probably eat less overall, just not at regular times or with any real nourishment. It's more like grazing, or eating for convenience. And there are times I'll eat just because I feel numb and want something to cut through the fog—even if it's just the texture of food or the routine of chewing.\n\nAnd then I avoid mirrors. I used to be able to look and see someone who at least looked like she had it together, even on hard days. Now it's like I don't recognize myself. I see someone who looks tired, and puffy, and… worn out. It's not just vanity—it's like a visual confirmation that I'm not okay.\n\nI miss feeling comfortable in my own skin.

And through all of it, there's this thread of remembering how things used to be, which makes the present reality that much more painful to navigate.\n\nAfter all you've shared, I'm curious about what has felt most important or meaningful about this conversation for you?
