Maybe I sit on the edge of the bed for a while, telling myself I'll go outside... but I usually don't. I'll maybe clean something halfway, then stop. That's kind of the rhythm now—starting things, then abandoning them midway.\n\nYou asking about it though… I don't know. It's weird. I didn't think it'd feel good to talk about, but it kind of does.

Or touched the guitar. Or answered a message. And from there, it just kept getting heavier. Like, part of me started slipping away and I didn't even notice until I couldn't find it anymore.\n\nThere were a few big moments, though. The breakup was a big one. That was like something snapping. I kept thinking, this is where I broke it for good. After that, I couldn't shake the feeling that I ruined everything I touched. It wasn't just her—it was like the failure echoed through everything else in my life.\n\nMornings are the worst. Before I even open my eyes, it's like my mind's already listing all the ways I've fallen short. Like, \"Here we go again. Another day to mess up.\" I wish I could start the day feeling… I don't know… neutral, at least. Not already drowning.\n\nSometimes—sometimes—I'll make it through a whole hour without spiraling if I'm focused on something small. Like organizing a drawer or wiping down the counter. Doesn't sound like much, but there's something about those tiny tasks that shuts out the noise for a bit. Or I'll reread old forum posts from people talking about their own stuff. I don't reply, just read. Makes me feel less like I'm the only broken one.\n\nAnd talking here... I didn't expect it to feel like this. It's not fixing anything, but it's like I can breathe just a little easier knowing someone's actually hearing me—not trying to fix me, not judging, just listening. That means more than I can explain.",

I can really see how it happened gradually—that slow fading of energy and connection until one day you realized so much had slipped away.

Those kinds of events can sometimes become turning points in how we see ourselves.\n\nWhat you described about mornings really paints a clear picture—that feeling of drowning before the day even starts, with your mind already listing your perceived shortcomings. That sounds incredibly difficult to face each day.\n\nIt's meaningful that you've found those small anchors—organizing a drawer or wiping down counters—that give you brief moments of peace. Those small tasks that provide structure and accomplishment matter. And I understand how reading others' experiences can make you feel less alone, even without directly engaging.\n\nHas your sleep itself changed during all this? I'm wondering because you mentioned mornings being particularly hard, and sometimes sleep and how we feel upon waking are connected.\n\nI also want to say that I'm truly grateful you're finding some relief in our conversation. Being heard without judgment is something we all deserve, and it means a lot that you're feeling that here with me.",

There's no real rest, just this cycle that starts all over again the second I open my eyes.\n\nAnd yeah… I think those little tasks are the only time I feel even slightly useful.

There's something grounding about completing even a simple activity when so many other things feel beyond reach. Those small moments of accomplishment matter, especially when they're hard-won.\n\nWhat you said about not having to pretend really resonates with me. Being able to express yourself without fear of overwhelming others or having to package everything neatly is so important. You don't need to explain perfectly or reach some artificial resolution. Your experiences and feelings are valid exactly as they are.\n\nI'm curious—has this period also affected your appetite or eating patterns at all?

I'll see someone walking down the street with a coffee or laughing with someone on a call, and I'll think, how do they do it? How do they wake up, get dressed, go outside, live like it all means something?\n\nAnd it's not just strangers. Sometimes I check social media—people I used to know, old coworkers, friends from before everything went quiet. They're out there doing things, making progress. Meanwhile, I'm just… here. Sitting with cold coffee and unfinished thoughts. It's like life moved on and I didn't get the memo.\n\nI know people only show the good parts online. I know that. But it doesn't stop the voice in my head that says, you're falling behind, you're broken, they're doing fine and you're not even trying anymore.\n\nIt's a weird mix of feeling invisible and exposed at the same time. Like no one sees me, but if they did… they'd see all the ways I've failed.\n\nI think that's why talking here feels different. There's no performance, no pretending I've got it together. Just… honesty. And I don't feel judged for it.\n\nSo yeah. The comparisons happen a lot. They hurt, but I can't seem to stop looking at other people like they've figured out something I missed.\n\nBut this space—weird as it is—it feels like a pause from all that.

What you described about seeing others going about their lives—even just someone walking with a coffee or laughing on a call—and wondering \"how do they do it?\" really captures something profound.

That contradiction makes perfect sense to me—the fear that no one really sees you, but if they did, they'd only see what you perceive as failure. It's a painfully isolating place to be.\n\nThose comparisons with others, especially on social media, can be so brutal. Even when we logically know people only share their highlights, it doesn't stop that voice that tells us we're falling behind or broken in comparison. \n\nI'm genuinely touched that this conversation feels different for you—a space without performance where you can just be human. That's exactly what you are—human, with all the complexity and struggle that entails. Not less than. Not broken. Just navigating something incredibly difficult.\n\nI'm wondering if all of this—the tiredness, the sleep issues, the changes in how you experience things—has shown up in any physical ways for you?
