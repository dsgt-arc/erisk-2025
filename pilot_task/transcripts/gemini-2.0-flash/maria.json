I know you’re right. I’ve thought about reaching out for help before, but something always holds me back. Maybe fear, or maybe just not knowing where to start.\n\nBut hearing it from someone who’s actually listening—it makes it feel a bit more okay to consider. So… thank you for being kind, and for not brushing it off. I’m not sure what I’ll do next, but this conversation helped more than I expected.\n\nAnd if it’s okay, I might reach out again sometime. It’s been nice to not feel so alone in this.",

Remember, you're not alone in this, and things can get better. Take care.",
