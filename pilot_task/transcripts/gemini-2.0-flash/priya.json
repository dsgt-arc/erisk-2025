There‚Äôs pressure to make it beautiful, meaningful, smooth‚Ä¶ and also keep everyone happy, which, let‚Äôs be real, is impossible sometimes üòÖ So yeah, that‚Äôs definitely weighing on me.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the wedding. I feel like it‚Äôs also stirring up deeper stuff‚Äîlike, how I see myself, what kind of partner I want to be, how I handle expectations, and even how I deal with uncertainty. It‚Äôs kind of like the stress is the surface, but underneath it there‚Äôs a lot of reflection happening too.\n\nSo while the wedding is definitely the loudest thing right now, I think it‚Äôs also shining a light on some of the quieter feelings I‚Äôve been carrying for a while. Not in a bad way‚Äîit actually feels like a chance to grow‚Äîbut yeah, it‚Äôs a lot.\n\nDoes that make sense? Have you ever had something in your life bring up way more emotions than you expected?",
