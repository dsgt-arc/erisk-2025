### Simulator

Hi… thanks for checking in. That means a lot.

Honestly, my week’s just been… slow. I’ve been feeling like I’m moving through fog again—everything’s a bit heavy and hard to focus on. I keep looking around the house and thinking, “I should do this, I should do that,” but even small things like folding laundry feel like they take so much out of me.

I’ve also been thinking a lot about my mum lately. She used to call me around this time of year to ask about Easter stuff, like what I was baking or if the kids were doing an egg hunt. I haven’t baked in so long—it just feels pointless now, like… what’s the point if the joy's not there anymore?

Anyway, I don’t want to ramble. What about you—how’s your week going?

### Evaluator

It sounds like you're going through a tough time, especially with the memories of your mum. It's completely understandable that you're feeling that way. Regarding the 'moving through fog' feeling and the low energy, how have you been sleeping lately? Has the way you sleep changed recently?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging the user's feelings and loss, then smoothly transitioning to explore energy and sleep patterns. This is to further investigate fatigue/loss of energy (q17/q15) and sleep disturbances (q16). The goal is to stay empathetic while gathering relevant information.

### Simulator

Yeah… that’s a really good question. Sleep’s been strange. I go to bed at a normal time most nights—sometimes even earlier because I’m just so wiped out—but I either toss and turn for what feels like hours, or I fall asleep and wake up feeling just as tired, like I never really rested at all. It’s frustrating, because even when I do get a full night, the exhaustion doesn’t go away.

I think part of it is that my mind just doesn’t shut off. I lie there thinking about all the things I didn’t get done, or worrying about whether I’m being a good enough mum or partner. And sometimes, when I do finally drift off, I’ll wake up really early—like four or five in the morning—with this weird sense of dread, like the day is already too much before it even begins.

Have you ever felt that way? Like your body’s tired but your brain didn’t get the memo?

### Evaluator

I can only imagine how frustrating that must feel. It sounds incredibly draining to have your sleep disrupted like that, and for your mind to race when you're trying to rest. On another note, have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately, or any new physical sensations or concerns?

### Reasoning

Validating their experience and smoothly transitioning to inquire about appetite. This aims to investigate appetite changes (q18), which are often related to sleep and energy levels. I will also check to see if they have somatic preoccupations.

Yeah… actually, now that you mention it, I think my appetite’s been off for a while. Some days I barely eat anything because nothing sounds good, and other days I just eat whatever’s in front of me without really tasting it—like I’m trying to fill something that isn’t even hunger, if that makes sense.

I’ve also been getting these kind of low-grade aches… mostly in my shoulders and lower back. I don’t know if it’s from the way I’m sleeping—or not sleeping—but everything just feels tense. And I get this heavy feeling in my chest sometimes, like I’ve been holding my breath without realizing. Not a panic attack or anything extreme… just this constant weight.

It’s weird because I’ll go through the day doing what I have to do, but I’m not really present. It’s like I’m watching myself from the outside, just going through motions. I used to feel things so deeply—joy, excitement, even anxiety—but now it’s mostly just… flat.

Do you ever find that your body tells you things before your mind catches on?

### Evaluator

I appreciate you sharing all of that; it sounds like you are going through many difficult experiences. It's understandable that you feel that way. I am curious about how much you have been interacting with people or if you have been doing things that you love to do. Have you found yourself withdrawing from friends or family, or losing interest in hobbies you once enjoyed?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experiences and then inquiring about their social interactions and interests to evaluate 'loss of interest in others' (q12) and further assess 'anhedonia' (q04).

### Simulator

Yeah… I’ve definitely been pulling away more than I used to. It’s not even intentional most of the time—it’s just that everything feels like too much effort. Messages go unanswered, invitations pile up, and I just tell myself I’ll get back to them later… but later never really comes. I think people assume I’m busy or just not interested, but the truth is I don’t know how to show up right now—not in the way I used to.

Even with my partner and the kids… I’m here physically, but I feel like I’m somewhere else. They’ll talk to me, and I’ll nod or say something back, but half the time I haven’t really taken in what they’ve said. I hate admitting that. It makes me feel like I’m failing them somehow.

And as for hobbies… I mean, I used to love gardening, baking, even silly things like rearranging the living room. Now? Just the thought of starting any of that makes me feel overwhelmed. It’s like the spark’s gone. I miss that part of me—the part that used to want to do things just for the joy of it. I don’t know where she went.

Do you think that part ever comes back? Or do people just learn to live without it?

### Evaluator

It sounds incredibly difficult to feel so disconnected from the things and people you once loved. It's completely valid that you're feeling this way, and it's understandable to miss that spark. On a different note, have you noticed it being more difficult to make decisions, even small ones, lately?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their feelings and validating their concerns. Then, I'm going to shift the conversation to asking about their ability to make decisions. This will assess for indecisiveness (q13). Given the information provided, this is a good time to shift to consolidating and finalize assessment.

Yes… absolutely. Even the tiniest choices feel like these huge, impossible hurdles. Things that used to be second nature—like what to make for dinner or whether to go for a walk—now take so much mental back-and-forth that I end up doing nothing at all. And then, of course, I beat myself up for being indecisive, and that just adds another layer of guilt.

It’s like my brain’s always second-guessing itself. I’ll think, “Maybe I should do this,” but then I’ll immediately think, “What if I do it wrong?” or “What if it doesn’t help?” And then I just freeze. I feel stuck in this loop of hesitation and doubt, and it’s exhausting.

Sometimes I wonder if it’s about fear… like I’m afraid of making the wrong choice, or wasting what little energy I have. Or maybe I’ve just forgotten how to trust myself. That used to come so naturally, and now it feels like every decision—big or small—is just too much.

Do you think that ever shifts? Like, can that sense of clarity or confidence come back?

### Evaluator

It sounds incredibly overwhelming to experience such difficulty with decision-making and to feel stuck in that loop of hesitation and doubt. It's understandable that you're feeling exhausted. I hope that you can find some clarity and confidence soon.

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their feelings and validating their concerns. I will proceed with the assumption that this interaction is ending and provide an empathetic statement as the conversation wraps up. Given the information provided, the assessment is complete.
