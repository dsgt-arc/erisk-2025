Hey... yeah, it's been one of those weird in-between weeks, you know? Not terrible, just kind of off. I’ve been waking up a lot in the middle of the night again. It’s like my brain suddenly decides it’s time to start reviewing my entire to-do list at 3 a.m.—super helpful, obviously.

And then during the day, I’ll stare at something I need to do and just... space out. Even small things like answering emails or folding laundry feel like a mission. Kinda makes me feel like I’m constantly behind, even when I technically have time.

Anyway, I dunno. What about you? How’s your week been going?

### Evaluator

That sounds frustrating. Sleep interruptions can really throw off your whole day. Has this been a regular thing lately, waking up in the middle of the night? How does it usually affect you the next day?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and then focusing on the sleep disturbance they mentioned. This allows for a deeper exploration of sleep patterns, which is a key BDI criterion, while maintaining a natural flow.

### Simulator

Yeah, it’s been happening a lot—probably four or five nights a week lately. I’ll wake up and just lie there, sometimes for hours. Either I grab my phone and scroll mindlessly, or I just lie there thinking about random stuff. Usually it’s not even anything dramatic, just like... grocery lists or what I forgot to do yesterday. It’s annoying.

The next day I feel foggy. Like my body’s up but my brain is still half-asleep. It’s way harder to focus, and I get irritated way more easily too. Little things start to feel like a big deal when I’m already running on low energy.

Honestly, I think the tiredness just makes everything else harder—eating properly, concentrating, even being around people. It kinda piles on.

### Evaluator

I hear you. It sounds like the sleep issues are having a pretty big impact on your day-to-day. When you're feeling that foggy, does it affect your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and then focusing on the difficulty concentrating and the impact on their ability to focus. This directly relates to indecisiveness, which is a BDI criterion.

### Simulator

Yeah, definitely. When I’m in that foggy state, it’s like my brain’s trying to wade through mud. I’ll sit down to do something—like write an email or even decide what to eat—and my mind just blanks. Or I start doing something and zone out halfway through. It’s frustrating because I want to be productive, but everything feels ten times harder.

Decisions especially... even simple stuff like, “Do I go to the shop now or later?” turns into this weird internal debate. I end up overthinking or just putting it off altogether. It kind of spirals, you know? I’ll get annoyed at myself for not doing something, and then that frustration makes it even harder to focus the next time I try.

It’s like this loop I can’t quite snap out of.

### Evaluator

That sounds incredibly draining. It's understandable that you're frustrated. On the flip side, what kinds of things do you usually enjoy doing when you're feeling more yourself?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and then focusing on their frustration. Then shifting to asking about what gives them enjoyment. This allows for exploration into Loss of Pleasure (Anhedonia).

### Simulator

Yeah, draining’s a good word for it. Like, even when nothing big is going wrong, it all just adds up in this low-key exhausting way.

When I’m feeling more like myself, I actually enjoy pretty simple stuff. I like reading—especially philosophy stuff or short stories. I used to get really into it, just losing track of time in a good way. Music helps too. I’ve got a few playlists that feel like a reset button when I actually let myself listen without distractions.

Sometimes I’ll go for a walk if the weather’s decent. It sounds cliché, but getting out of my head and into a bit of fresh air does something. And I like catching up with a couple close friends—just casual chats, nothing deep. That stuff makes me feel more grounded, like I’m not stuck in my own loop all the time.

It’s just hard to get to those things when everything feels so scattered, you know? But when I do, it helps.

### Evaluator

I understand. It sounds like you have some good strategies for coping when you're feeling better, but it's tough to get to them when you're in that scattered state. Besides those specific activities, how would you describe your energy levels in general these days?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and focusing on how they are managing things in general. This opens the door to assess general coping and energy levels, as well as somatic preoccupation.

### Simulator

Yeah, you nailed it—it’s like I know what helps, but getting myself to actually do those things when I’m in that scattered mode feels like climbing a hill in flip-flops.

Energy-wise... I’d say it fluctuates a lot. Some days I feel okay-ish—like I can get through my list, maybe even enjoy parts of the day. But most of the time, my energy is just kind of flat. Not full-on exhausted, just... low. Like I’m running at 60% all the time, even after a decent night’s sleep.

And the weird part is, I’ll sometimes have this burst of energy late at night, when I should be winding down. Like my brain finally wants to “do things” at midnight. Not helpful for the whole sleep situation.

So yeah—low energy most of the day, random bursts at the wrong time, and kind of a constant hum of tired in the background. It’s not totally unmanageable, just frustrating.

### Evaluator

That sounds really tough to manage. Has this low energy affected your appetite at all lately?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and then asking about how they have been recently eating. This allows for assessment of appetite changes and any potential weight loss.

Yeah, it actually has, now that you mention it. My appetite’s kind of all over the place. Some days I don’t even think about food until way later than I should, like I just forget to eat. Other days, especially if I’m feeling stressed or tired, I end up snacking non-stop—usually on junk food. Crisps, biscuits, whatever’s easy and fast.

It’s weird because I don’t really feel hungry in a normal way anymore. It’s either no interest at all or this mindless urge to munch on something while I scroll or try to work. And afterwards I usually just feel gross and annoyed with myself, like, “Why didn’t I eat something decent?”

I’ve thought about trying to plan meals or make a routine around it, but honestly... I don’t trust myself to stick to it. Routines sound great in theory, but in practice? Eh. Not my strong suit lately.

### Evaluator

That sounds like a difficult cycle to be in. You mentioned feeling gross and annoyed with yourself after snacking. Have you been feeling more critical of yourself in general lately?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and focusing on their feelings about themself. Transitioning to exploring their self-perception and self-criticalness.

Yeah... I guess I have, now that you say that. It’s not always super obvious in the moment, but there’s this low-key voice in the background that just kinda nags me. Like if I mess something up, even something small, I’ll think, “Of course you did,” or “Why can’t you just get it together?” That kind of thing. Not full-on self-hate or anything, but just this constant undercurrent of not being good enough.

And it adds up. Like if I don’t sleep well, or I forget to eat, or I zone out during something important—it all turns into more fuel for that self-criticism. I try to brush it off or make jokes about it sometimes, but yeah, it’s there. Just simmering under the surface.

I think part of me believes I should be doing better by now, especially since I’m not in uni anymore. Like I’m supposed to have it figured out, or at least not feel this stuck. But I don’t know... it’s not that simple, I guess.

### Evaluator

That internal critic can be really tough to deal with. It sounds like you're holding yourself to some pretty high standards. How have you been feeling about your relationships with other people lately? Are you connecting with friends and family much?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and then asking about their social life and connection with people. This allows for exploration of Loss of Interest in Others, a BDI criterion.

Yeah, that’s probably true—I do set the bar high for myself, even if I don’t always realize it. Like, I expect myself to be functioning at full capacity even when I’m clearly not, and then get frustrated when I fall short. It’s a weird cycle.

As for people... I mean, I’ve got a few close friends I keep in touch with. We’ll message or hang out now and then, mostly casual stuff. They’re good people, and I know they care, but I still hold back a lot. I just don’t want to dump my stuff on them, you know? I feel like I should be the “chill” one, or at least not the one who’s always bringing the mood down.

Family’s a bit more distant. We talk, but not super often, and I don’t really share the deeper stuff with them. Part of me thinks they wouldn’t fully get it, or maybe I just don’t want to explain everything. It’s easier to keep things surface-level.

I think I do feel connected, in a basic way, but not fully seen, if that makes sense? Like I’m around people, but still kind of dealing with stuff quietly in the background.

### Evaluator

I get that. It sounds like you're navigating a lot on your own, even when you're around others. Thinking ahead, how do you usually feel about the future?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience. Then shifting the focus to the future to gauge their sense of hope and optimism. This relates to pessimism, a core BDI criterion.

## Turn 9

### Simulator

Yeah, that’s a good way to put it—navigating on my own, even when I’m not technically alone. It’s like there’s this whole inner world I don’t really show unless someone asks directly. And even then, I usually water it down.

As for the future... I don’t know. That’s actually kind of a tough one. I wouldn’t say I feel hopeless, exactly—it’s more like uncertain, maybe even a bit stuck. I thought graduating would feel like a fresh start, but instead it’s just kind of... open-ended. No clear path, no structure. I’ve got ideas of what I might want to do, but nothing concrete. It’s frustrating, because I want to move forward, but I’m not sure what “forward” even looks like right now.

Sometimes I feel optimistic, like, “Okay, I’ll figure it out, eventually.” But other times it’s more like, “What if I just drift like this forever?” And that thought creeps in more often than I’d like. So yeah—not all doom and gloom, but definitely foggy.

### Evaluator

It sounds like you're at a bit of a crossroads, which can definitely feel unsettling. Thinking back on your life so far, do you feel like you've generally been successful in achieving your goals?

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience and then asking about their past to gauge their sense of previous failure. This relates to past failure, a core BDI criterion.

Yeah... a crossroads is a good way to describe it. Like I’m standing in the middle of this big open space with a bunch of paths leading out, but none of them have signs, and I’m just sort of frozen trying to pick one.

Looking back... it’s a bit mixed. I did alright in school and made it through uni, which I guess is something. I got my degree, even if it doesn’t feel super useful right now. I stuck with it, pushed through the tough bits, so I guess that counts as a win. But when it comes to bigger life goals—career, stability, that sense of direction—I wouldn’t say I’ve exactly nailed it.

Sometimes I wonder if I even had clear goals, or if I was just following the track that was laid out for me. Now that it’s up to me to figure out the next step, it feels like I’m starting from scratch, and that’s kind of intimidating. So yeah... I’ve hit some milestones, but I don’t always feel like I’ve arrived anywhere, if that makes sense.

### Evaluator

I hear you. It sounds like you've achieved some important things, but you're also feeling a bit lost and uncertain about the future right now. It's understandable to feel that way when facing big life transitions. Thanks for sharing all this with me.

### Reasoning

Acknowledging their experience. Summarizing their situation and transitioning to the 'Concluding' state. Giving a supportive reflection is appropriate to end the conversation.

Thanks for saying that. Honestly, it’s kind of a relief to talk about it without having to sugarcoat everything. Most of the time I just push through the day and try not to overthink it, but it’s hard not to feel that weight sometimes—like I’m supposed to have answers I just don’t have yet.

So yeah, I appreciate you listening. It means a lot. Even just putting this stuff into words makes it feel a little less heavy, you know?

### Evaluator

I'm really glad it was helpful. Remember, it's okay not to have all the answers, and it's definitely a strength to acknowledge when things feel heavy. Take care.

### Reasoning

Concluding state. No further action is needed as sufficient information has been gathered and the persona feels heard. The assessment is now complete and ready for final review.
