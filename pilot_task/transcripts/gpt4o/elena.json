Just this tired, faded version of who I used to be. Someone who doesn’t smile much, who avoids her own reflection more often than not. I used to have a sense of who I was—even if I wasn’t always happy, I at least felt real. Now it’s like I’m just… occupying space.\nI question my worth constantly. I don’t feel useful, or wanted, or needed. And when I do think of something I should do—like reach out, or clean up, or even just try to care—it’s like there’s this voice in my head saying, What for? No one would notice anyway.\nThere are times I remember little pieces of who I used to be—someone with plans, with friends, with reasons to get up in the morning—and it feels so far away it’s almost like I’m remembering someone else’s life. Like I was just borrowing it for a while.\nAnd the thing is, I don’t even know where the shift happened. There wasn’t one big moment… just this slow unraveling. And now I don’t know how to gather all those pieces of myself again, or if they’re even still there.",

Recognizing that sense of loss of self and worth is deeply impactful, and it seems to have been weighing on you for some time.

Whenever you're ready, talking this through more deeply with someone who can offer support might help—but for now, just acknowledging it here is a significant step.",
