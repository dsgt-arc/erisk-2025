The fresh air, the sound of birds, or seeing a neighbor’s dog... it sort of reminds me that the world is still going, even when I feel like I’m at a standstill. Also, when I manage to cook something simple—like scrambled eggs or a soup—it feels oddly grounding. I don’t enjoy it the way I used to, but there’s comfort in the steps, like muscle memory. Stirring, seasoning, tasting—it makes me feel like I exist in the moment for a little while. But those moments are… rare, I guess. They kind of come and go, and I never know when I’ll have the energy to try. Still, when they do happen, I notice the difference, even if it’s subtle.

As for setting goals… I’ve thought about it, but to be honest, it often feels like another thing I’ll end up failing at.

It’s strange—just giving myself permission to do something small and not tie it to progress or productivity feels like a quiet kind of relief. I sat in the sun earlier, just like we talked about. Not for long, maybe ten minutes, but I noticed the warmth on my skin and the way the dust danced in the light. It didn’t fix anything, but for that moment, I wasn’t thinking about everything I haven’t done or all the ways I feel behind. I was just… there. I might try doodling later. No pressure, just pen to paper. Even if it’s just scribbles or circles, it feels like a little promise to myself. That I’m still here. Still trying, in my own quiet way. Thanks for holding space for that. It means more than I can say.",

Holding onto that understanding can be a powerful ally as you navigate through each day. Whenever you feel like sharing more or need a space to reflect, I’m here for you. Take it at your pace, and cherish those small promises you make to yourself—they can be profoundly meaningful.",
