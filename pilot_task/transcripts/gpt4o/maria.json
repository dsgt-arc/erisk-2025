I don’t even know how to put that into words properly, but thank you for making space—for not rushing me, or minimizing things. Just… being steady. I’ll hold onto this conversation for a while, I think. It’s a quiet kind of comfort I didn’t know I needed. And yeah… maybe next time we talk, I’ll be able to share something lighter. Or maybe not. But either way, it’s good to know you’ll still be here. Take care, okay? Really.",

Whether it’s sharing something lighter or continuing where we left off, I’ll be ready to listen at your own pace. Remember, there’s no rush. I’ll be here when and if you're ready to talk again.
