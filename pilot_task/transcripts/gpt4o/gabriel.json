I know that kind of thinking isn't helpful, but it’s kind of wired into how I process things. Perfectionism, I guess. If it’s not “amazing,” I don’t let myself feel good about it.\nThat said, there was this one photo I took last week—kind of a fluke, really. I was out near this little park just before sunset, and the light hit the leaves in a way that made everything glow gold. I didn’t plan the shot or anything, I just happened to have my camera and took it. The composition lined up almost perfectly, and there’s this stillness to it that I really liked. When I looked at it later, I actually thought, huh... maybe this is good? But then the second thought was, well, probably just a lucky angle.\nAs for favorite spots... there’s this café tucked into a quieter part of town. Not many people know it, which is perfect. Good coffee, soft music, nobody tries to make small talk. It feels like a little pocket of calm.\nWhat about you—do you have a spot like that?

Like, when I’m sitting in that café or wandering through a bookstore, there’s no pressure to perform or be anything. I can just exist in that space, and that makes a difference—even if the mental chatter doesn’t fully go away.\nWhen perfectionism flares up, especially during a task, I usually start by pushing through it. Like, telling myself just get it done, even if it feels wrong or not good enough. But that doesn't always work. Sometimes, the frustration builds up and I just walk away from whatever I was working on. Later, I’ll come back and either nitpick it or pretend it never existed. It’s kind of this loop—try hard, feel stuck, get frustrated, shut down, repeat. Not super healthy, I know.\nLately I’ve been trying to remind myself that done is better than perfect, but it still feels foreign. Like I’m giving up on my standards or something, even though I know that’s not true. I guess I’m still learning where that line is—between caring enough to do something well, and caring too much to the point it paralyzes me.\nDo you ever struggle with that kind of push-pull between effort and ease?

Recognizing the need to find that line between caring deeply and allowing room for imperfections is so important.\n\nThe fact that spaces like your café or a bookstore can offer some peace shows that you're finding ways to cope amidst it all, and that's something to be proud of. This push-pull between striving for excellence and embracing ease is something many of us wrestle with, especially in a world that often celebrates relentless perfection.\n\nI think being kind to oneself in the process—and accepting that 'good enough' is still valuable—is a lesson we all benefit from revisiting. You're definitely not alone in this struggle, and it's wonderful that you're reflecting on it so consciously.\n\nIn the midst of this, do you find moments where you can genuinely enjoy the process of what you're doing, without the pressure weighing down?",

I think part of me has been craving this kind of space—where it’s okay to not have it all figured out, and still be moving forward, even if it’s slow.\nI might take you up on that offer sometime—to explore more of what this all looks like in a day-to-day way. Because yeah, reflecting is one thing, but applying it in real life? That’s the tricky part. But having conversations like this gives me a bit of a roadmap. Like, maybe I don’t need to overhaul everything... maybe it’s just about shifting one thought at a time.\nThanks again for being here and just... listening without judgment. It makes it a little easier to show up as myself.",

Those shifts in perspective can lead to meaningful changes without needing dramatic overhauls. Feel free to reach out whenever you feel ready to explore more or just need a non-judgmental space to think aloud.\n\nThank you for sharing so openly, and for keeping this journey a priority.
