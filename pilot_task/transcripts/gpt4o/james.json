It’s quiet, no one really out, and I can just... think. Or not think. Depends on the day. I wouldn’t say it makes me feel good, exactly, but it helps take the edge off. There’s also this old hobby I used to enjoy—building little models. Planes, ships, that kind of thing. I haven’t touched them in years, though. Lately, I’ve thought about dusting off one of those kits in the closet, just to see if I still care. But even that feels like too much some days. It’s weird, right? The things I used to like are still there, technically, but the motivation to start is what’s missing. Like there’s this invisible wall between me and everything that might help.

I used to care about this.” I didn’t do anything with it, just put it back in the box. But for a second, it felt like I remembered a version of myself that had more... spark, I guess. I can’t say it lasted long. As usual, the feeling faded once I stepped back into the house and got hit with the usual to-dos. But yeah, maybe that was something. A flicker again. It’s strange, isn’t it? How those tiny moments can stir something up—just enough to remind you of what used to matter. Makes me wonder if that version of me is still in there somewhere.",
